# Project Specifications
## Structure
Organize articles into volumes and issues. Put links to PDF files on the homepage for each issue. This will probably require a JSON file for each issue (or can I do it with special front matter in the editor's letter?). 

Citation information should be included in each article. 

Figure out how to do biographies. 

Make a submissions page. 

## Visual Design
Talk to Elyse. 

## Project Deadlines
The next issue prints by February 24. 

## Required Materials
Word documents; PDF of the issue. 

## Domain
We'll figure this out. 

## Stuff
I'll get access to the Westmarch Google account with a folder with everything from the last issue. 

## Other things
Donate button.
