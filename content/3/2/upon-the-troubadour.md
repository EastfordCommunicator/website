Let me tell ye of those days

Ere the sea killed Hope

Let me tell of what I know

Before ye heave the rope.

The *Troubadour,* that mighty bark

She was my lady fair

And stole she all my heart away

Tho' she were long and spare

Her gleaming decks were polished bright

With gilded sunny sheen

Her mainhead carved from oaken beam

And painted cheery green

And I, the men, and officers

Lined up to pay our due

To this dear lady, newly met,

And to our Captain too.

The Captain, name of Ferguson,

Was quiet, dark, and grim

Each man aboard would bow his head

Than look direct at him

> *Sailors all, if ye be men,*
>
> *And would like men be free,*
>
> *O choose your captain wisely, man,*
>
> *Or choose dark misery*

The *Troubadour* she travelled fast

And flit upon the wind

Beneath her prow the foaming waves

Like laughter split and skimmed

And we, the sons of Lamech's son

Worked out our forty days

Heaved the rope, and heeded well

Our captain and his ways

It chanced when once I clambered up

Upon the mizzenmast

I saw a broad and darkling cloud

Advancing on us fast

The stormhead mighty towered high

A fearful breathing thing

And as we scrambl'd 'bout the deck

Our Captain's voice did ring

"Forward, all ye cow'ring dogs,

And face the swelling sea!

If ye be men, then act as men,

Or ye'll be facing *me.*"

> *Sailors all, if ye be men,*
>
> *And would like men be free,*
>
> *Stand and fight for what is right*
>
> *And never think to flee*

Wet ropes, wet hands, we slipped and pulled

At last we furled the sails

And as I gazed towards the prow

My heart began to quail

For there stood Captain Ferguson,

Upon the dark fo'castle

His hands were clasped, he faced the storm

His Nature-birthèd vassal

As Heaven flung its lightning down,

His shadowed form was cast

In glaring light, a maddened blight

Fell on him in the blast

For still he seemed to hold that light

Within his darkened eyes

And still he drove us onwards as

The storm at last did rise

The stores! Alas, most all were lost

Unto the tossing spray

We begged our Captain let us halt

His will we could not sway

The storm had lifted from our decks

The shredded clouds dispersed

And though we asked to find a port,

Our Captain only cursed.

Look, there is land, with waving palms

And water bright and clear

But no, it's no, and on we go

Our course we cannot veer

> *Sailors all, if ye be men,*
>
> *And would like men be free,*
>
> *Remember through it all ye are*
>
> *Alone upon the sea*

Onward, onward, ever on

Into the failing sun

Come, get thee onward, get thee gone,

The race is never won.

Heave to, and swing, and furl the sails

Now do it once again

Ne'er dare to drink, nor dare to think

Forget what makes ye men

One day, as I lay festering

Beneath the midday blaze

I felt a withered, pliant hand

Creep through my distant daze

It gripped my arm with fearful strength

And feverish intent

I squinted up to see a face

In dreadful wonderment

It was a man from down below

Who used to keep the food,

His face was pale, with darting eyes,

Both witherèd and shrewd.

He scrabbled anxious like a rat

But held me firm as oak,

The truth he told, it echoed deep

In every word he spoke.

"Now listen, man, and listen well,

To what I have to say:

This sea is cursed, and we are lost,

And will not find our way.

"The storm hath sent us off our course

The Captain claims to know

Where we have been, and still are now,

And where we mean to go.

"Yet he is blinded to the truth,

Insists we near our port

He presses on, though starv'd we are,

And nothing him shall thwart.

"All we who know the truth, me lad,

Must stand against the lie,

We must turn round the *Troubadour,*

Or every man shall die."

His pale eyes flickered as he spoke

And turned towards the prow

Our Captain stood eternal as

The waves the ship did plough

> *Sailors all, if ye be men,*
>
> *And would like men be free,*
>
> *Protect your brothers from the waves*
>
> *And dark eternity.*

What could I do? Lord God, what else,

Where is the righteous rod?

Alone, alone, and nothing else

But mutiny for God.

The sun beheld, the wretched sun

He watched us sell our souls

He hissed and grinned and travelled on

And still he onward rolls

We turned about, and made our way

In search of nearby land

We prayed within our perjured hearts

With folded, cracking hands

Strange were those days, and strange the sights

That each of us beheld

By strange and horrid magic spell

It seemed that we were held

I thought I saw the Captain's form,

From the mast he hung,

I heard a voice in cold reproach,

And to us whispers clung.

> *Sailors all, if ye be men,*
>
> *And would like men be free,*
>
> *Beware the men who hold your fate*
>
> *And twist your destiny.*

So here I am, upon the block

A rope about my neck

A hundred men alone at sea,

A body on the deck.

You may tell me I did wrong,

And chose the falser side

But we were brothers, braving waves,

And brothers would have died.

Can power to one man be owed

Upon the desert sea?

Can he command to forsake land

And sail for Jordan's lee?

If I would save my fellow man

Is that a justice done?

Would you not justly turn against

All kings to save thy son?

So come and heave upon the rope,

Ye sailors, lift me high.

And know ye all, seafarin' men,

'Tis for your sake I die.

> *Sailors all, if ye be men,*
>
> *And would like men be free,*
>
> *Come share my length of twisted rope,*
>
> *There's room enow for ye.*
