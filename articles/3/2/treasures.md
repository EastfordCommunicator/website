Golden hour, the delirious exuberance of life; Phoebus<br>
Descends into the glassy waves<br>
And the distant horizon erupts tempestuously <br>
With nacreous clouds. Shower of ecstatic light,<br>
Dance of flickering rapture upon the sea-<br>
He pines for treasures in the deep not knowing they are here.<br>
Specks of shadows over the soft sand, scattered,<br>
Silhouettes of rocks and shells, reefs spilling into the shallows<br>
Their rugged forms, like bottles tipping over;<br>
Drifting kelp and pine planks, white sails racing for the sinking sun<br>
And the exquisite aroma of the salty breeze-<br>
Found are the feverish flares of forgotten dreams. <br>
And how majestic the sound of the sea: <br>
The plash of waves rolling towards land, foamy waters<br>
Brushing the soft sand, and children splashing through the shallows,<br>
And the songs of fishermen as they count their spoils;<br>
Above the head the seagulls cry their frenzied cries<br>
To the winds, they take our sorrows to the distant land. <br>
Had I the fingertips of Midas and a quill of tears,<br>
To make brisk for love the pulse of weary hearts, <br>
Still will my arias pale compared to this symphonic chant,<br>
So take this heart and carve over this precipice, alas, <br>
Unuttered rests the insatiable yearn for life â€“<br>
He craves for more and more, for ever more.
