*"A sense of great masses moving at visionary speeds, of giants dancing,
of eternal sorrows eternally consoled, of he knew not what and yet what
he had always known, awoke in him with the very first bars of the
deep-mouthed dirge." --C.S. Lewis*

*"We could not bear the beauty and the burning." --Dante*

Have you ever felt the singing of the spheres?<br>
The harmonies of light wound ‘round the world,<br>
The searing strands of reckless joy unfurl’d<br>
Across the cosmos and inside our souls?

Have you ever felt more broken and more whole?<br>
Like every cut and crack and tear and scar<br>
Bleeds with the light that burns within the stars—<br>
The most healing kind of pain I’ve ever known.

Have you ever felt that, when creation groans<br>
Beneath the weight of all this weary, wounded hope<br>
It moans a song that strives to mend what evil broke<br>
That in its sadness is more beautiful by far?

Do you feel this, when you look upon the stars<br>
And their music resonates within your bones?<br>
That all the might of one small speck of light, alone<br>
Is enough to tear through all the darkness here?

Have you ever felt the singing of the spheres?
