Ponder and scheme, you old man of knowledge.<br>
Search in vain for your great prize.<br>
Your works and dreams, timeless and noble,<br>
shall still dim and fade, just as your eyes.

Men before and after you<br>
labor in this darkened room,<br>
hiding in books and words and symbols,<br>
Looking for gold among the gloom.

Go therefore and escape your cave.<br>
The power you want is held only by one;<br>
No man can turn the common to the fine. <br>
How could you dare to live like the sun?
