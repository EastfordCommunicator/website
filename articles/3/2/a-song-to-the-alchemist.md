Ponder and scheme, you old man of knowledge.
Search in vain for your great prize.
Your works and dreams, timeless and noble,
shall still dim and fade, just as your eyes.

Men before and after you
labor in this darkened room,
hiding in books and words and symbols,
Looking for gold among the gloom.

Go therefore and escape your cave.
The power you want is held only by one;
No man can turn the common to the fine. 
How could you dare to live like the sun?
