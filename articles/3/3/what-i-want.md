I want an armchair,\
Tall, and made of worn leather; highbacked to rest tired bones.\
I want a hearth,\
Made of stone and blackened by the fires of countless winters past.\
I want a library,\
With shelves too full, bent to bowing by the weight of knowledge.\
I want a desk,\
Old and made of wood, cluttered with pages of poems, unfinished.\
I want a porch,\
With peeling paint and creaking boards, garnished with a mat. "Welcome"\
I want a piano,\
Loud and out of tune, keys faded to yellow by unwashed hands.\
I want a kitchen table,\
Scratched by pens, stained with wines, and scarred by the memory of cups without coasters. \
I want a Bible,\
Old, and falling apart yet ever true; covered in so much ink it is hardly readable.\
I want a bed,\
Big and soft, quilted by nights of youth in love, a cozy terrace of dreams.\
I want a garden,\
Wiled and untamed, bursting with fruit and petal: the spoils of natural toil.\
I want bedtime stories,\
As pleasant and as thrilling as they were first told, animated by the imagination.\
I want memories,\
Thoughts to cherish that tell the tale of a life well-lived, one that made living worthwhile.\
I want a box,\
Simple and made of pine&hellip;

Then unneeded,\
I will leave behind the chair, to fit another room,\
The hearth, to warm another heart,\
The library, to shape another mind,\
The desk, to hold another pen,\
The porch, to welcome another friend,\
The piano, to play another song,\
The table, to serve another meal,\
The Bible, to save another soul,\
The bed, to bring another dream,\
The stories, to teach another child,\
And the memories, with those I made them with,\
And I will embrace my bed of soil.
