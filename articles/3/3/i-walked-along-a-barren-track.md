I walked along a barren track\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a path prepared by blood\
To rip and tear the mother's back\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shear the hair upon their head\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh of earth by man is led

When Father Sky no more is seen\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mother Earth no rest will have\
When Brother Sun by man is made\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sister Moon is trodden 'cross\
The flesh of man will melt as dross

And will the souls of men survive?
Perhaps, if flesh might be revived.
