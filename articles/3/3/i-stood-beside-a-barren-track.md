I stood beside a barren track\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a path prepared by blood
And there upon the mother's back\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there above a mother borne\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh of Man by man is torn

There Brother Sun did lose his light\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sister Moon was bathed in blood\
For Father God had turned his sight\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mother Church new life begot\
The flesh of God our flesh has bought

And will the souls of men survive?\
Perhaps, for flesh has been revived.
