Dear Reader,

Our theme for Westmarch this Easter season is "Transformation." In springtime, the earth transforms before our eyes, as brown gives way to green and flowers burst forth from the cold earth. Literature throughout the centuries has been filled with individuals experiencing radical transformation. Our criticism section highlights the spiritual transformations of *Crime and Punishment*'s Raskolnikov and *Till We have Faces*'s Orual, examining the radical conversion that accompanies repentance. As Neil David Mangrobang's paper on Psalm 22 illustrates, this transformation is only made possible through our Savior's transformation of suffering into victory. At the root of these transformation stories is the story of the gospel—the truth that is transforming the world.

As I reach the end of my time on the Westmarch editorial team and look forward to new opportunities, I reflect on the ways this experience has transformed me. To the rest of the Westmarch staff—Anna, Kaitlyn, Abbie, and Elyse—thank you for making the journal a truly beautiful thing. To everyone who has submitted their writing to Westmarch, thank you for sharing your creative work with this community. And to all who read, thank you for participating in the sharing of the poetry and story on campus. It is my hope that literature continues to transform us all. 

Lauren Crane, Editor-in-Chief
