As we begin to transition to shorter days and colder nights, Jennifer
and I are busy planning holiday events here at the library!

Story Time, Maker's Night, Grim Reader's Book Club, Movie Night,
Children's Crafts and our very first Holiday Fair will be filled with
festive cheer! We are excited to recognize Rebekah Budd for her drawing
of the Ivy Glenn Memorial (pictured). Her beautiful illustration will be
showcased on tote bags created by The Friends of the Eastford Public
Library as well as our brand-new library cards.

A sincere thank you to all our patrons who have continued to be very
welcoming! There is so much to love about our small town, and I look
forward to the future.
