In the spirit of this Thanksgiving season, the Eastford Grove Cemetery
Association extends its sincere thanks to several groups.

We want to start with comments on the beautification work of Andert
Construction, Mike and Joe Andert in particular, who took the large,
classic old gates at the north end of the cemetery for a thorough
refinishing. With the help of Eastford town employees, Ben and James,
the gates were removed and returned safely. We thank them all. Another
beautification improvement has been the planting of eight spiraea bushes
on the parking lot side of the property, an effort led by David Barlow
and assisted by Rick Torgeson, Beverly and Victor Salcius. Also, Eastern
Construction, owned by Gary Whittenburg, corrected the erosion problem
in the southwest corner of the parking lot.

Finally, a word of appreciation to the Trustees, Corporators and friends
who removed the veteran and fire department flags on Nov. 13. All of
this has been done to support the cemetery, which is not a town-owned
property. If you would like to contribute to our beautification efforts,
please use the form below.
