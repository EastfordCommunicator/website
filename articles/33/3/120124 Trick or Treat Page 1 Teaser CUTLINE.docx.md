EASTFORD --- The town was filled with Halloween cheer in October as the
town hosted two \"Trunk or Treat\" events for kids. The first event, at
Buell\'s Orchard on Sunday, Oct. 27, featured more than a dozen stations
for kids to visit. The second event was the town\'s official Trunk or
Treat event on Thursday, Oct. 31, which featured even more trunks for
kids to enjoy. Above, at left, Owen Barlow is a mad scientist at the
town\'s Trunk or Treat. At right, Lorenzo (dressed as Rocky Balboa) and
Elena Coccola (dressed as a \"creepy clown\") get into character at the
Buell\'s Orchard event.
