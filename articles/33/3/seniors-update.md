Attention seniors! We now have an official Eastford Seniors Committee!
If you would like to join and get more information, please contact Vice
Chairman Michele Palulis at [michele@attorneypalulis.com](mailto:michele@attorneypalulis.com), or (860)
928-9928. I would like to create a membership list with contact
information, so going forward, I can send out e-mails of events,
information, meeting dates, etc. If you'd like to be on the committee as
a chairman, secretary, treasurer, or even just assisting with the
month-to-month planning, please let me know. If you just want to stay up
to date on events and what's happening, let me know! You do not need to
be a senior to be involved and join the fun!
