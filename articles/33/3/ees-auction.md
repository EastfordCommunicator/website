EASTFORD --- The numbers have been officially crunched. After a night
full of frenzied sales and fundraising on Saturday, Nov. 16, the EES
Goods and Services Auction boasted one of its highest totals in recent
memory, netting $18,247, according to auction officials as of press
time. Those numbers could change slightly as some items are finalized.
The event featured a live and silent auction, as well as a raffle, baked
goods and coffee sales, pizza sales and other donations. All of the
proceeds will be deposited in an account that funds the annual
Washington D.C. eighth grade field trip, this year slated for June 3-6,
2025.
