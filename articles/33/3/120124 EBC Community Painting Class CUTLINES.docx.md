EASTFORD --- Eastford Baptist Church hosted its latest Community
Painting Class on Saturday, Oct. 19, bringing together many who wanted
to explore their artistic side. The event, which was held in the
church\'s Family Activity Center, explored a peaceful island and ocean
scene, using acrylic paint on canvas. The Community Painting Nights are
held periodically throughout the year. For more information, or to be
