DePercio nets another hat trick in win over Ashford

EASTFORD --- Wes DePercio scored three goals in the first half, and Cam
Bibeault added his first goal of the season in the second half, as the
Eastford Bulldogs took care of business on the road, defeating Ashford,
4-1, earlier this afternoon.

Eastford's offensive attack peppered Ashford's defense early and often,
and DePercio took advantage of a clear shot from outside the box to bomb
one in from a distance to make it 1-0 early. Another quick shot by
DePercio slipped through the goalie's fingers only minutes later to make
it 2-0. Just before halftime, DePercio attacked again from the right
side, putting it into the back of the net to make it 3-0 at halftime.

In the second half, Ashford created several opportunities to score, and
took advantage on a breakaway, slipping one through to make it 3-1, but
minutes later, Cam Bibeault, the Bulldogs' usual goalie, now playing
forward, scored his first goal of the season on a throw-in play to make
it 4-1, and securing the Eastford win.

The Bulldogs are now 7-1 (4-1 at home, 3-0 on the road), and will next
face Canterbury tomorrow, Thursday, Oct. 17, at 3:30 p.m., at Baldwin
Middle School in Canterbury.
