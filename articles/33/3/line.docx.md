Bulldogs suffer first loss of season against Pomfret

EASTFORD --- Going into this afternoon\'s contest between the Eastford
Bulldogs and the Pomfret Eagles, neither team had yet to lose a game on
the season. Unfortunately for the Bulldogs, their undefeated streak came
to an end, as the Eagles soared to a 7-1 victory on Eastford\'s home
turf.

Blake Gilbert got the scoring started first for the Bulldogs with an
early goal off a corner kick by Wes DePercio only minutes into the
contest to make it 1-0. But the Eagles responded with seven straight
goals --- two in the first half and five more in the second --- keeping
the pressure on to claim a statement win.

The Bulldogs had their opportunities to respond to the Eagles\'
onslaught, but Pomfret's defense proved to be enough to stall their
offensive attack.

The Bulldogs are now 4-1 on the season. They will look to regroup next
Tuesday, Oct. 8, in a home game against Wheeler Middle School (North
Stonington), at 3:30 p.m.
