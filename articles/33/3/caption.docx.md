Mitchell, Bibeault come up clutch in final moments as Bulldogs survive
in OT thriller

EASTFORD --- Aiden Mitchell netted a goal late in extra time, and Cam
Bibeault had a diving, game-preserving save with less than minute left
to lift the Eastford Bulldogs to a 3-2, extra-time win earlier today
against Parish Hill.

The contest started with both teams trying to break through, but both
defenses remained locked in tight. Late in the first half, Eastford
struck first, as Charlie Ellsworth scored to make it 1-0 in favor of the
Bulldogs. That score would remain through halftime. Early in the second
half, Wes DePercio drove home his 13^th^ goal of the season to make it
2-0, but a series of offensive mistakes by Eastford allowed Parish Hill
to even the score with two scores only minutes apart, leading to a 2-2
tie at the end of regulation.

Both teams remained deadlocked through the first 5-minute overtime, each
having their share of chances, but about halfway through the final extra
time period, Mitchell found paydirt with a strong strike that put the
Bulldogs up 3-2. Parish Hill found themselves with several chances on
offense near the end of extra time --- but a final, spectacular save by
Bibeault preserved the hard-fought win for Eastford.

The Bulldogs are now 6-1, and will next face Ashford next Wednesday,
Oct. 16, at 3:30 p.m., at Ashford Middle School.
