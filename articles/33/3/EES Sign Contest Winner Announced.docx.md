HEAD: EES Sign Contest Winner Announced

EASTFORD --- The votes have been tallied, and the results are in.

On Friday, Nov. 8, Eastford Elementary School students, teachers, and
staff gathered at the front entrance of the school to announce the
winner of the annual sign contest, which has the honor of being featured
on an insert on the school's main sign for the entirety of the 2024-25
year.

The finalists this year were designs by fifth grader Zoe Labonte, first
grader Avriella Barber, and second grader Rio Souvigney. As the sign was
unveiled, Souvigney was announced as this year's winner. She won a \$25
Amazon gift card for the win, while the other two finalists received art
supplies as a runner-up award.

The theme for this year's sign contest was "Where Does Reading Take
You?" The contest was open to all students. Three finalists were
selected by the PTO, and voting on the three finalists' designs was
conducted by EES students to determine the winner.
