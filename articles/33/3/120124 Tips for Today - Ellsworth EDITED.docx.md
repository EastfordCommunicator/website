**Tips for Today**

Happy December!

Be inventive with your holiday gift wrapping. Newspapers, magazines, and
colorful shopping bags all make great wrapping paper, especially if you
decorate and add your own personal touch. Wrap gifts in new, festive
dishtowels, or cloth napkins, and plan to deliver cookies in reusable
holiday tins. Make the wrapping paper a piece of your gift.

Are you sending holiday cards this year? There are several ways to be
eco-holiday festive! Make your own cards out of magazines and wrapping
paper, order your photo cards from a planet-friendly company, or send an
e-card. Express your wishes for good health, love, and peace in an
eco-minded manner.

Have a safe and happy holiday season!
