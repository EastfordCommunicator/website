title: Ashford/Eastford Scout Troop 92 Update
---

Scouts have been busy this fall. The Scouts and Cub Scouts joined
together to decorate Ashford's Babcock Library with Halloween
scarecrows.

Early in November, the Troop camped out at historic Ft. Adams in
Newport, R.I. Ft. Adams formerly protected Newport and Narragansett Bay
from attack dating back to colonial times. This camping trip focused on
navigating through the woods using a map and compass, often referred to
as land navigation, or orienteering. Many skills related to being safe
in the woods and what to prepare for were also taught. Substantial parts
of the fort remain for examination.

In other news, scouts were a color guard in two veterans ceremonies, the
multi-town Korean Veterans Ceremony, and the Ashford School Veterans
Ceremony.

- Upcoming Events: December will be a short month because of the holiday
season. Scouts will enjoy a holiday party at the regular meeting. Cub
Scouts are invited to attend as well. The Troop is discussing the
possibility of a ski trip this winter instead of the annual Klondike
Derby.

- The Cubs of Pack 92 have had a busy start to the year also. Their
first pack meeting included minute-to-win-it games and
getting-to-know-you activities. The Bears and Webelos learned about the
necessities for outdoor cooking activities and how to set up a tent.
They were excited to teach the other members of the Pack how to make
Foil Packet Pizza and Banana Boats over a campfire.

- At the November pack meeting (held at Mordavsky Pavilion) we had a Red
Flag Warning, which meant no campfire! The Cubs had to switch it up and
use electricity instead of open flames to make walking tacos and
s'mores! The Cubs also learned about the Scout Oath and Scout Law. They
worked together to list the Scout Law in the correct order and created
their Pack 92 Flag.

- Scout meetings are at St Philip's Recreation Hall, second and last
Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. New members are welcome.

Happy Holidays from Scout Troop 92 BSA, Ashford/Eastford: Nord
Yakovleff, Assistant Scoutmaster; Jesse Burnham, Scoutmaster; Rob Hany,
Committee Chairman; Kurt van Heinigen, Cubmaster.
