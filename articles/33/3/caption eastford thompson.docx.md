Bulldogs' offensive struggles continue in shutout loss to Thompson

EASTFORD --- The Eastford Bulldogs had several chances to put the ball
in the back of the net --- including two penalty kicks --- but couldn't
get on the board for the second straight game, as they dropped their
second consecutive shutout loss earlier today, this time to Thompson
Middle School.

Both teams looked to be equally matched as the game began, as both teams
had chances to attack on offense. Eastford had the first close call on a
failed penalty kick, but Thompson recovered quickly, booting the ball
down the field and creating a breakaway that resulted in a goal.
However, it was called back due to an offsides penalty. Both teams
countered each other's' attacks, leading to a 0-0 stalemate at halftime.

Only minutes into the second half, Thompson's offense sparked, winning a
contested ball with Eastford goalie Cam Bibeault, and poking it into the
net to put Thompson up 1-0. Minutes later, Thompson stole an Eastford
inbounds throw, and scored again, to go up 2-0. Another score with about
8 minutes left put Thompson up for good, 3-0, earning them the victory.

For Eastford, it was the second consecutive game in which they did not
score a goal.

With only two games to go in the regular season, the Bulldogs are now
7-3 (4-2 at home, 3-1 on the road), and will look to rebound against
Pomfret next Tuesday, Oct. 29, at 3:30 p.m., at Pomfret Community
School.
