Scramble ready to predict future on 'Duck Day'

EASTFORD --- Every midwinter, Americans across the country gather to
hear from groundhogs whether winter will end early or last for another
six weeks.

Eastford has its own unique tradition. For the past 10 years, fans both
in town and in the surrounding area have gathered to hear Scramble the
Duck's forecast for the rest of winter. According to legend shared with
the groundhogs, if Scramble sees his shadow, winter will last, but if he
does not see a shadow, spring will come early. However, in contrast to
his furred rivals, Scramble boasts a perfect accuracy rate.

Once again, Scramble will make his prediction on Sunday, Feb. 2, at 7:30
a.m., at Eastford's Ivy Glenn Memorial. Following an opening speech,
Scramble will secretly confer with his handlers about his prediction.
Then, a translated announcement will be read to the audience. Fans are
encouraged to come to the event to experience the historic moment.

Duck Day, as the event has come to be known, has become a staple for the
winter months in Eastford. Fans enjoy spending time in community when
the cold weather prevents much other outdoor activity. Scramble's
accurate prediction, combined with community lightheartedness, helps
pass the winter months.

The Feb. 2 event will also be live streamed for those not able to attend
in person. More information can be found on Scramble the Duck's website,
scrambletheduck.org.
