Bulldogs held scoreless for first time in tough loss to Canterbury

CANTERBURY --- The Eastford Bulldogs couldn't get out of the gate
offensively, and allowed two early goals, as they lost to Baldwin Middle
School, 2-0, earlier today at Robert Manship Park in Canterbury ---
marking the first time this season they were held without a score, and
only the second loss of the year.

Canterbury went on the attack early --- scoring on a lob from the right
side, and again off a free kick from the left side within the first 10
minutes of the game --- going up 2-0. Staunch defense by Canterbury held
steady throughout the rest of the game, and while Eastford had their
chances late, solid goaltending would secure the shutout win for
Canterbury.

The first half of the game was eerily reminiscent of the two teams'
first matchup on Sept. 24 at Eastford. In that game, Canterbury also
scored twice to start that game, but Eastford would go on to score three
straight goals to complete the comeback 3-2 win. The same result was not
in the cards today, as the offense struggled to get momentum. The game
today was the first of the season in which the Bulldogs did not score a
goal.

The Bulldogs are now 7-2 (4-1 at home, 3-1 on the road), and will look
to get back in the win column against Thompson at home next Thursday,
Oct. 24, at 3:30 p.m., at Eastford Elementary School.
