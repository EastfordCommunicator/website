EASTFORD --- The Eastford Bulldogs' 2024 soccer season --- much like a
game --- was a tale of two halves.

The Bulldogs started the season on Sept. 17 like they had something to
prove, scoring eight goals in an 8-1 win over Parish Hill in Chaplin.
Forward Wes DePercio scored four goals (the first of what would become a
20-goal season), while Charlie Ellsworth netted three of his own to lead
the Bulldogs. This was followed by another dominating win over Ashford
on Thursday, Sept. 19, in which DePercio scored another hat trick. A
much closer 3-2 win over Canterbury at home saw DePercio score another
hat trick in a comeback victory, which gave him 10 goals in his first
three games.

The hot start continued on Oct. 1, in a 1-0, extra time nailbiter win at
Thompson, in which DePercio continued his hot streak, scoring the game's
only goal in the extra time period to put the Bulldogs on top, and
leading Eastford to a perfect 4-0 start to begin the season.

The Bulldogs' first defeat would come at the hands of powerhouse Pomfret
(the eventual division champions), who defeated Eastford 7-1 in an
overwhelming display of offense that would become their signature of
their undefeated championship season.

The Bulldogs would eventually run off three consecutive wins --- a 4-1
win over Wheeler at home, a 3-2 extra time victory over Parish Hill at
home, and a 4-1 win over Ashford on the road, to run their record to an
impressive 7-1.

Unfortunately for the Bulldogs, wins would be a rarity for the rest of
the season. Back-to-back shutouts to Canterbury (Oct. 17) and Thompson
(Oct. 24) would send the Bulldogs reeling, leading to another blowout
loss at Pomfret on Oct. 29. Despite losing three of four games, Eastford
would go on to clinch the second seed in the playoffs, behind \#1
Pomfret, and ahead of \#3 Canterbury and \#4 Thompson.

A 2-1 victory over Wheeler in the final regular season game sent the
Bulldogs into the playoffs with a bit of momentum --- but it was not
enough, as Canterbury took Eastford to extra time, and eventually
defeated the Bulldogs in penalty kicks to end Eastford's season in
heartbreaking fashion.

Despite the tough loss, the Bulldogs lived up to their name, showing
resilience and tenacity on the field. After the season, the team
gathered one last time at an after-school pizza party on Tuesday, Nov.
12. *Communicator* Managing Editor Adam Minor, who covered the team all
season, surprised the players at the party with the inaugural
end-of-season Communicator Awards, which honored the team's top
performers in several categories, the winners of which were decided by
both Minor and Coach Jennifer Barlow. After the Communicator Awards were
given out, Barlow surprised her team with her own set of awards. A
complete list of the awards given can be seen below.

Congratulations once again to the Bulldogs for a great season!
