EASTFORD --- The town was filled with Halloween cheer in October as the
town hosted two "Trunk or Treat" events for kids. The first event, at
Buell's Orchard on Sunday, Oct. 27, featured more than a dozen stations
for kids to visit. The second event was the town's official Trunk or
Treat event on Thursday, Oct. 31, which featured even more trunks for
kids to enjoy.
