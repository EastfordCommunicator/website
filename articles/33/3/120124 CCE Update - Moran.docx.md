**Congregational Church of Eastford**

Greetings to all from the Congregational Church of Eastford. We want to
invite you to some holiday events! Check out the Calendar section in
this edition of the Communicator for more!

Here are some updates about our church. We are excited about the future!

First, our rebuilding is moving forward, and we expect to break ground
soon (weather permitting) on our new site on John Perry Road. Our new
building will be spacious, all on one floor, and will include lots of
space for kids, adults, events, meetings and worship --- and spacious
outdoor grounds.

Second, we are finishing up the demolition work at the 8 Church Road
site. The plan is for a park-like setting suited to outdoor ministry
events and to just come and be still. Oh, and winter sledding, too!

Third, we officially "installed" our new associate pastor, Evan Burgess,
on Nov. 10. Please join us in welcoming him and his wife Chelsey and
young son, Roman. Our vision is that Evan will work alongside Pastor
Mike for what will probably be a few years, after which Evan will take
on the lead role. We are excited as he brings a love of the Lord, of
people, and youthful energy (he is 32 years old) to help us step into a
future with the up-and-coming generations.

In closing, we would love to have you check us out at one of our events,
or any Sunday morning at 10 a.m. at the Eastford School. There's
childcare for littles, a program for kids 5-9 years old and a warm
welcome for all. We offer a lot of programs for many sorts of needs --
check us out at cceastford.org.

Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!
