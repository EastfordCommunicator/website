Eastford Recreation was so happy to see all those who joined us for
Heart of Eastford 5K Run & Experience Eastford. We had an incredible
turn out of volunteers, vendors, and citizens, which allowed us to raise
more than $3,000 for William Hull and Eastford Food Pantry. Eastford
Recreation thanks everyone for their efforts and participation.

We are excited to announce upcoming events. Day of Play will return Aug.
25, from 1-3 p.m., and the Eastford Town Wide Tag Sale will be held Aug.
17-18. Both event flyers can be found on the town's website and Facebook
page, with locations/registration links attached. Stay informed of
events via Eastford Recreation page on the town website. If you have
ideas and would like to help generate more events and activities, join
the Eastford Recreation Committee, and help us make Eastford active
again!
