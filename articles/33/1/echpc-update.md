The Eastford Conservation and Historic Preservation Commission (ECHPC)
is a town-appointed commission providing information on the natural,
agricultural, and historical resources of our town. We meet on the first
Tuesday of the month at 7:00 p.m. at the Town Office Building, lower
level. Meetings are open to the public.

Recent projects include: Encouraging Pollinator Pathways, monitoring for
evidence of invasive plants like water chestnut, partnering with other
groups to support informative talks like the May talk on her book,
"Beaverland," by Lelia Philip, and the talk by UCONN's Robert Thorson
entitled "Historic Stone Walls of Northeast Connecticut."
