EASTFORD --- On Saturday, June 22, the Eastford Public Library hosted
bestselling suspense author Vanessa Lillie for a book signing and
interview. Lillie was promoting her latest novel, "Blood Sisters."
Lillie lives in Rhode Island, and is an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee
Nation in Oklahoma. Jody Blanchette, who runs the library's mystery book
club "Grim Readers," interviewed Lillie about "Blood Sisters." Attendees
then enjoyed refreshments.

## Summer Reading Program Continues

What's happening in the library in August? We're finishing our summer
program, "A Magic Treehouse Summer." Can you or your children
participate even though you're not signed up for the program? Yes, you
can, but please call us to sign up for individual programs. We have you
do this so that we have plenty of materials for all the children and so
we don't go over the room capacity set by the building inspector.

We will also be collecting backpacks, lunch boxes and school supplies to
give to Eastford Elementary School.

This year we are celebrating the beloved "Magic Treehouse" books by Mary
Pope Osborne.
