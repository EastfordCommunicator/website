Did you know that in 1872, Sumner Hill Road was called Yetter Hill Road?
It was named for Andrew B. Yetter, who owned the farm at the top of
Yetter Hill. A truckman from New York City, he was president of the
Atlas Storage Company, the Globe Storage & Carpet Cleaning Company, and
he also ran one of the several companies that did the city street
sprinkling. He had a stable of horses to pull the many horse-drawn
delivery wagons needed for his businesses. When the horses became lame
or footsore from the cobble stone pavement, they were shipped to the
Abington rail station and then brought to the Yetter Hill. After a
restorative stay on the farm, they were shipped back to the city and
returned to service. The farm also grew hay that was shipped to the city
to feed them.
