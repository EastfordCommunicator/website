Progress continues on the Ashford Road Bridge over Bigelow Brook.
Estimated date of construction is 2027. CHA Consulting and CT DOT have
been very communicative and open with the residents and the town
regarding plans. This will be a total replacement, so we expect 8 months
of road closure and detour. This bridge was built originally in 1937 and
is rated as poor. The bridge replacement is grant funded 20 percent by
federal or state funds and 80 percent by state funds.

[The new town website](https://eastfordct.gov) is going live in the
middle of July. We hope this site makes it easier to locate information
about Eastford. There are still items that will be added, and department
information will be expanded soon.

Upgrades have been done at Crystal Pond Park and the Ivy Glenn using
STEAP grant funds. We hope to have all scheduled work completed in the
next few months.

Town committees/commissions are always looking for new members. Many
people have ideas or thoughts about things happening in town. By joining
a committee you would have a voice in shaping these thoughts and ideas.
