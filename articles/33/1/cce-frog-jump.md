EASTFORD --- The Congregational Church of Eastford held its annual Frog
Jump, Band Concert & Cookout on Saturday, July 13, at Crystal Pond Park,
a tradition that has been upheld despite the church's current lack of a
permanent home base. The East Woodstock Cornet Band performed several
songs, while hamburgers, hot dogs, and ice cream were served throughout
the evening, free of charge. The lake was open for swimming, a bounce
house available for bouncing, and the night was capped with the annual
cake walk, which awarded several desserts to those in attendance. At the
event, the Fabulously Fun Family Fundraiser, which was held the previous
Saturday, July 6, awarded a check to CCE with the proceeds from the
event, totaling \$31,202.79.
