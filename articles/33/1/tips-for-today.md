Fireflies/lightning bugs bring childhood magic into our summer evenings.
They are in need of our support, and here are some actions you can take.

1. Learn about fireflies. Did you know that fireflies are not actually
flies? They are winged, soft-bodied beetles.

2. At night, turn off your outdoor lights. Artificial lighting can
interrupt the glow-light-blinking-patterned communication between
potential firefly mates.

3. Avoid spraying weed-killing chemicals in your yard as these toxins
damage the lifecycle of fireflies.

4. Join in on the "Low Mow May" campaign and carry it through the
mowing season. Fireflies love long-grass yards and meadows.

5. Participate in a community-science project and report the fireflies
in your community to the Xerces Society
([https://xerces.org/endangered-species/fireflies/community-science](https://xerces.org/endangered-species/fireflies/community-science)).

6. Increase the number of native plants, of varying sizes, in your
yard. Fireflies love flowers and hide in long-leafed plants in the day.
Firefly expert Terry Lynch recommends planting pine trees because they
offer shade, and the "low light area provided by a canopy actually
increas\[es\] the amount of time fireflies have to find a mate. Also,
the litter produced by pine trees, if left to accumulate, provides a
good habitat for earthworms and other small animals which firefly larvae
feed upon."

Which action do you think you'll try? Meanwhile, enjoy finding some
fireflies in town this week!
