The Congregational Church of Eastford offers programs open to the
community designed to help people in various sorts of spiritual,
emotional and practical need.

Grief Share: The Congregational Church of Eastford will be offering a
program called "Grief Share" beginning in October 2024. The program is
designed to help people deal with the grief associated with the loss of
a loved one. The format includes a video presentation regarding grief
and a time of group discussion led by people who have walked through
grief of their own. Many people have found comfort and hope through this
compassionate program. The activities this fall include:
- "Loss of a Spouse" - Single session seminar, Sunday, Oct, 27, from
2-4 p.m.
- "Grief Share" - Thirteen-week series, Sunday afternoons from 2-3:30
p.m., Nov. 3 through Jan. 26, 2025.
- "Surviving the Holidays" - Single session seminar, Thursday Nov. 7,
6:30-8:30 p.m.

There is no charge. All Grief Share sessions are at the Congregational
Church of Eastford offices at 4 County Road (right next to the Post
Office). [Register on the Church website](https://cceastford.org/griefshare/).

Celebrate Recovery: Powerful biblical, Christ-centered 12-step

kinds of present or past abuse and addictions, anger, codependency,
eating disorders, and more). Ages 18 and over welcome. Our program meets
weekly at the First Congregational Church of Pomfret. Tuesdays 7-9 p.m.

Adult Caregivers of Aging Loved Ones: Dealing with aging loved ones

A quick update from Pastor Mike at the Congregational Church of
Eastford. We continue to be grateful to our community and friends for
all the support following the loss of our beautiful church building. You
all are wonderful! It has been nearly a year and a half since the fire.
Things take time, but we are making good progress toward our new
building. We have acquired almost nine acres of land on John Perry Road
and will be building a new, one-story facility there. The developing
design will give us larger worship space, lots of kids' space to include
an indoor play area, and a large community room to host receptions and
events. It is our hope that we can be a rich blessing to Eastford and
our greater community as we move into the future.

We are also adding to our staff, having called an associate pastor named
Evan Burgess. He and his wife Chelsey grew up in Manchester, Conn., and
have been serving a Christian missionary agency the last several years.
They have a young son, Roman. They will be joining us right at the start
of October. Our vision is that Evan will work alongside Pastor Mike for
what will probably be a few years, after which Evan will take on the
lead role. We are excited as he brings a love of the Lord, of people,
and youthful energy (he is 32 years old) to help us step into a future
with the up-and-coming generations.
