Calling all Pumpkins!

Autumn is here --- full of all those things we love --- colorful leaves,
bonfires, spooky stories, cooler weather, apples, candy, football,
Halloween, and all-things pumpkin.

Perhaps, and hopefully, you still grab pumpkins for your front steps, or
take joy in the childhood fun of carving Jack-o'-lanterns? Grab an extra
pumpkin and fashion it into a bird feeder, or use your Halloween
"leftover" Jack-o'-lanterns to make one, too. Pumpkins make a strong
pedestal and re-purposing the gourds into feeders is recycling at its
best.

The quick guide: Cut a pumpkin in half and hollow out the seeds. Grab
some sticks for perches (to push through a side of the pumpkin), and a
bit of string to hang it up. All you need after that is some bird seed.
Mass Audubon and the National Audubon Society both have easy-to-follow
directions will some additional tips. [If you're a video/visual person,
here's the pumpkin birdfeeder "how-to" via YouTube from The National
