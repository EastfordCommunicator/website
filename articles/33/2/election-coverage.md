*The Eastford Communicator sent a questionnaire to both candidates, with the same questions, with the same rules. These answers are edited due to space constraints — but every care was taken to preserve points made by the candidates, in the interest of fairness.*

###  In your opinion, what are some of the most important issues facing the 35th Senate District, and Eastford specifically?

"The #1 issue that is on the minds of everyone I meet, talk, and work with is the high cost of living and taxation in Connecticut. Other issues of concern are public safety and public education. These are all issues that I have been working on as a State Senator."

### How do you hope to tackle these issues if re elected to the State Senate?

"I will continue my strong track
record of working with and
working for people. For
example, I advocated for and
helped pass historic income tax
cuts, increases in the earned
income tax credit, and expansion
of tax exemptions for retirement
accounts, pensions, and IRAs. I
worked to stop $2.5 million in
public education cuts to the
Senate District and worked to
increase state funding overall for
public education. I stand strong
in providing law enforcement
with the resources they need, to
empower them to do what they
are trained to do to keep us safe
and help us when we need help,
and to hold criminals
accountable for their crimes. I
stand strong in defending all of
our individual rights, parental
rights, and medical freedoms,
and have a track record of doing
so. And, as A state senator and a
doctor, I have worked
successfully to keep needed
health care services in our region
and to help expand services,
including maternal health, labor
and delivery, and women’s
health."

### Why did you decide to run for re election to the State Senate?

"I am running for re election to
continue the work I do every day
for the people of Eastford and of
the 35th State Senate District. It
is an honor to serve, including
being someone who provides
constituent services for people
when they need help."

### Talk about your background. What makes you stand out as the best choice for State Senator?

"I have a strong track record of
public service. I was the
Chairman of Woodstock’s
Planning & Zoning Commission
for 15 years. I have been serving
as State Senator for two years.
My work ethic is to roll up my
sleeves, delve into the work that
needs to be done, learn the facts
of what is going on, tell the truth,
provide people opportunities to
have their voices heard, and
always use common sense. My
track record is strong for
working with people, working
for people, and working together
to get good things done. I often
say that it is not just what a
person does that matters, but also
how they do it. On both accounts
I have a proven, strong track
record. I serve on the Public
Health, Public Safety,
Appropriation, and veterans &
Military Affairs Committees,
which provides me good vantage
points to serve the 35th Senate
District. I am also a Co Chair of
the Rural Caucus to help our part
of the state."

### Can you share a personal story or experience that highlights your commitment to public service?

"Two experiences come to
mind about my public service at
a personal level. First, when I
was chairman of Woodstock’s
Planning & Zoning Commission,
there was young family that
sought my help understanding
how to use the land they bought
to build a house and start a small
business home occupation. They
were confused by the town’s
zoning regulations. I was able to
help them. I was able to update
the zoning regulations to make
them easier to understand and
better able to serve the people of
the town.

Second, during my time as a
State Senator, I have been
approached by many veterans
who need assistance learning
about and accessing services
they have earned through their
service to our country. I have
been proud as the Ranking
Member on the Veterans &
Military Affairs Committee to
help them and their families."

### What is the most important thing you would say to an undecided voter heading to the polls on Nov. 5?

"You want and deserve a State
Senator who works hard every
day, works for you, tells the
truth, lets you know what is
going on, seeks hearing from
you, and is a strong voice for
you to get things done with a
track record of proven results. I
am the state senator serving you
that has that track record. Let’s
continue to work together."

## Merry Garrett (D, Challenger)

### In your opinion, what are some of the most important issues facing the 35th Senate District, and Eastford specifically?

“The cost of living in the district,
[including] incredibly high
Eversource rate hikes. Property tax
increases, coupled with lack of
funding for education, laying off
teachers and support staff. Slow or
no modernization of infrastructure.
Our senior citizens, young adults,
and middle class families need
affordable, attainable, inclusive
housing options to allow them to
stay, downsize, or move back to
[their hometowns]. Our regional
hospitals need to re establish
maternity care and other services.”

### How do you hope to tackle these issues if elected to the State Senate?

“We need to investigate price
gouging. As companies make
record breaking profits, we
continue to pay the price. The
Eversource situation should have
been addressed before we received
increases. … I will fight price
gouging at every opportunity.
We must start getting our fair
share of funding from the state.
Receiving a grant here or there is
not enough. Our general funds
require more to allow us to increase
funding for education, seniors, and
property tax stabilization.
We need to make adjustments to
outdated planning and zoning that
stymies opportunity for middle
class citizens by adjusting building
codes, turning empty commercial
properties into home, land use, and
other uses.

It is time regional hospitals
became part of the state hospital
system. We do not want our health
to become a commodity owned by
private equity firms. I will fight for
our district’s hospitals. … Every
person in our district deserves
available and quality health.”

### Why did you decide to run for election to the State Senate?

“I have been asked to run for this
seat several times over the years.
Senior citizens and middle income
families are struggling when they
should be prospering and saving.
Young people want to come back
to the district, but cannot afford to.
Teachers are being laid off or are
leaving the district. Environmental
issues, health care, and other issues
have seen no progress. As I have
lived in eastern Connecticut my
entire life, I will always stand up
for what is right and do what is best
for our district without
compromise.”

### Talk about your background. What makes you stand out as the best choice for State Senator?

“I bring a fresh, new perspective
and an extensive, highly successful
business background as a director
of Regulatory Insurance
Technology and small business
owner. I have been civically
involved with many committees
and non profit organizations over
the years. My family is union
strong, works in law enforcement
(State Police) and the Stamford
Superior Court, and in the military,
from brigadier general to staff
sergeant. As someone that started
their career in the tobacco fields at
13, and has lived/worked in
Connecticut my entire life, I
understand people from every walk
of life.”

### Can you share a personal story or experience that highlights your commitment to public service?

“I was a Brownie and a Girl
Scout. I was always civically
involved, from the American Red
Cross to the U.S. Marine Corps
Toys for Tots program, to Habitat
for Humanity, to Tolland Together
with the Hartford Foundation for
Giving, etc. Many times, years
later, someone tells me about how
they paid it forward due to
something I did to help them. It’s
always humbling.

For example, when called upon
by the Governor's Prevention
Partnership to help create a
mentoring program to include
corporations and local schools, I
created safety protocols to protect
children. Working with the GPP
was life changing. It was many
years later when a former student
recognized me [and] told me about
her decision to become a registered
nurse. She told me the mentoring
program was the first time someone
really took an interest in her … and
she never forgot that. It was a
heartwarming conversation and
wonderful that she was paying it
forward.”

### What is the most important thing you would say to an undecided voter heading to the polls on Nov. 5?

“I am here to represent all people
in the district, regardless of
affiliations. I’ve been endorsed by
the Independent Party and the
Working Families Party. My family
is involved in law enforcement and
the military, as well as union
members. Results matter. … I will
fight to ensure we are no longer an
afterthought. I will do the work, as
I have done my entire stellar
career, to ensure success.
