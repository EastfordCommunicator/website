EASTFORD/ASHFORD â€” Cub Scout Troop 92 was the Honor Guard and marched in the Ashford Family Fun Day Parade on Sept. 15. In September, the Troop held a Court of Honor to award merit badges and advancements in rank earned during the summer. We welcomed former Cub Scouts into Troop 92. The Troop also doubled in size! Older Scouts instructed the newcomers in scouting, starting with knot tying. Upcoming activities include fall hiking, campouts, and Scouting instruction.

Cub Scout Pack 92 will kick off another year with their first pack meeting on Friday, Oct. 4, at Knowlton Hall, at 7 p.m. The first pack meeting is a great time for girls and boys entering first to fifth grade to come and see all that the scouts have to offer. The theme of the first meeting is games and they will have something for everyone. New members are welcome.

Troop 92 BSA: Nord Yakovleff, Assistant Scoutmaster; Jesse Burnham, Scoutmaster; Rob Hany, Committee Chairman; Kurt van Heinigen, Cub Master
