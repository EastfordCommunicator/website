The Eastford Conservation and Historic Preservation Commission is a
town-appointed commission providing information on the natural,
agricultural, and historical resources of our town. We meet on the first
Tuesday of the month at 7 p.m. at the Town Office Building, lower level.
Meetings are open to the public.

Among its duties, the ECHPC continues to monitor the trails in town,
including a section of the Boston Turnpike Trail, the Old Connecticut
Path in Crystal Pond Park, and the George Askew Trail. Recently, we also
have been working on an inventory of the historic stone walls in
Eastford.
