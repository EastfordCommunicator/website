*Annual program raises more than $1K for missionary family*

EASTFORD — Eastford Baptist Church hosted its annual Vacation Bible School nightly from Monday, July 29 through Friday, Aug. 2. The theme, “Scripture Safari,” placed the children in an African safari theme as they learned about the Bible in their nightly lessons. In all, 92 children registered for the event, who through a Penny War all week, raised more than $1,000 for Caleb and Melissa Gibello, missionaries currently serving in Papua New Guinea. The week concluded with a family BBQ in the church’s Family Activity Center. Next year’s Christmas-themed VBS, titled, “Christmas Chronicles: Celebrating the Birth of the Savior,” is currently slated for July 28-Aug. 1, 2025.
