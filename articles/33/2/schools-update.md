The transition from summer to fall has been a busy and very rewarding
time for the Eastford Community of Learners. Although the official
enrollment date is Oct. 1, 2024, we started the school year with 171
Eastford Elementary students and 55 high school, magnet and outplaced
students.

Hopefully, you have noticed the esthetic and safety improvements of our
school grounds that resulted from the completion of the paving of our
driveway, playground and middle school walkway. This paving project has
been a personal goal and a part of our long-term facilities plan. A
special thanks to P. Willis Construction for their flexibility and
willingness to work around our school schedule needs. Thanks also to Deb
Richards for her efforts in obtaining a grant that covered the cost of
paving the driveway and the playground and to our Public Works team for
oversight of the work in progress. This project is truly a great example
of the strong school, town, and community partnership spirit in
Eastford.

Please join me in welcoming to the Eastford Elementary staff the
following new staff members: Seth Budd, Mary Dennison, Chelsea Friedmann
(paraeducators) and Tammy Goodwin (nighttime custodian). The Eastford
School District is currently seeking people who are interested and
qualified to serve as substitutes for teachers and/or paraeducators. If
interested, [please review the application process on the school website](https://www.eastfordct.org/about-us-contact/employment-and-rpfs/employment-and-rfps/).

Our grant-funded after-school programs, under the direction of Candice
Mead, is off to an exciting beginning. New and exciting programs have
been added to the after-school schedule at no cost for students in
grades K-8. We will also continue to offer free after-hours family
partnership programs throughout the 24-25 school year. 
[Please check our website www.eastfordct.org](https://eastfordct.org) or contact the school office,
860-974-1130, for information regarding these offerings. Remember to
also check the website for the very timely and informative newsletters
written and distributed by Principal Carole McCombe.

As we move through October, I continue to embrace the excitement for new
learning in the 2024-25 school year. Please note that the invitation to

new ideas is open to all members of the Eastford Community, regardless

course, it is only with the generous and ongoing support of the caring
members of Eastford community that we can continue to provide an
outstanding educational opportunity for our students.
