EASTFORD — More than 100 children convened at Eastford Elementary School every morning during the week of July 22-26 for the annual Sports Camp event hosted by the Congregational Church of Eastford, Living Proof Church in Ashford, and UW Sports Ministry. The theme of the week was “Undefeated,” based on Romans 8:37-39, and kids were given instruction in several sports, including basketball, soccer, flag football, and cheerleading. Kids also participated in singing, rallies, and Bible lessons during the week.
