We once again have an official United States flag disposal box on the
steps outside the Eastford Post Office. Flags will be picked up and
receive proper disposal courtesy of American Legion Post 111.

In November, the first selectman, along with State Sen. Jeff Gordon and
State Rep. Pat Boyd, attended a ceremony honoring Korean War veterans.
Among the Eastford veterans honored and still living were Randolph W.
Whaples Jr. and Anthony S. Tiemann.

The Bowen's Field Committee has met twice and continues to make plans to
open the Little League field for spring play. If interested in helping,
contact Liz Scranton through the Board of Selectmen's Office at

The annual EMD meeting was held with the Eastford EMD taking the annual
loyalty oath given by Director Bill Turner, CT DEMHS. This meeting and
oath are just one requirement that allows Eastford to receive grant
money from CT DEMHS and FEMA.

Volunteers make up all the town's committees and commissions ---
Planning Commission, Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission,
Conservation and Historic Preservation Commission, Recreation
Commission, Transfer Station Committee, and the Crystal Pond Park
Commission. If you are interested in joining any of these committees,
please contact the Selectmen's Office at [emily.john@eastfordct.gov](mailto:emily.john@eastfordct.gov).
Thank you, volunteers!
