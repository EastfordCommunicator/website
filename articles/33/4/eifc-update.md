Happy New Year, and welcome 2025. We hope you all had a happy and safe
holiday season. Here at the EIFC, we are always trying to stay up to
date with technology. Our dispatch agency has made some changes and
allow us to add information to help us if you have an emergency at your
residence.

You will find a QR code in a special section at the end of this update
for you to scan. By filling out this form with basic information, we can
pull it up while responding. All this information will be kept
confidential and the only way to see it is if there is a call for
service at your address by us. Thank you for your support!

The final number for responses in 2024 was 240. A detailed breakdown for
the year is as follows:

- Rescue & Emergency Medical Service Incidents: 134 (55.8%)
- Service Call: 38 (15.8%)
- Hazardous Condition (No Fire): 24 (10%)
- False Alarm & False Call: 27 (11.3%)
- Fire: 14 (5.8%)
- Good Intent Call: 3 (1.3%)

2024 was a good year for us within the ranks. Although some of our calls
were tough and challenging, your volunteer fire department responded
with upmost professionalism, skill and support from KB Ambulance. We
also managed to have a little fun in celebration of the holiday season.

Happy Halloween! We participated in "trunk or treat" at Buell's Orchard
and the school parking lot for an all-time high number of ghosts and
goblins making the rounds. In May, fire department flags were installed
at the Grove Cemetery in recognition of our departed department
comrades, i.e., firefighters, rescue, fire police, ladies' auxiliary.
Flags were removed after Veteran's Day.

Education is always ongoing for members. Chief Doug Beaudoin, Lt. Gordon
Spink, Lt. Dave Jakubowski and Veteran Member Jeannine Spink renewed
their 40-hours EMS certifications. November and October Wednesday night
drills included truck checks, situational (scenario) training, cold
weather emergencies and chimney fires.

Merry December! A piece of apparatus driven by members was decorated
with colored lights to participate in the 23rd Putnam "Dazzle Light
Parade" sponsored by WINY. "Breakfast with Santa Claus" was a total
success serving approximately 125-plus children and adults pancakes and
to hear the wants of our little children and some "much older" children.
There was no charge, just a donation to the Food Pantry or the EIFC. A
photo from the fun is included with this update!

Rounding out 2024 was our annual Christmas party for members and their
families; good food, laughs and fun had by all.

The firehouse "Renovation Project" is progressing slowly, we need your
help. We value your support in what we do, and maintain our structure as
best we can. Please send your tax-deductible donation to EIFC, P.O. Box
333, Eastford, CT 06242.

The EIFC regrets to inform you that former Life Member Dwain McNeal
passed away on Jan. 6, 2025. Dwain joined in 1973, served as a
lieutenant and captain, and retired as a member of the Fire Police.
Dwain was always a visible participant at department fundraisers.

## Tips for Your Safety

"I just went out to check my mail. How did I end up like this?" Falls
happen to everyone, but if you're over 65, a fall can change your life.
Falls are the leading cause of injury for ages 70 and over and
considered more common than strokes, and as serious as in their
consequences.

Fortunately, falls can be prevented. You owe it to yourself and your
family to find out how. Risks include difficulty walking, getting up or
sitting down, losing balance, taking four or more medications on a
regular basis, drops in blood pressure, dizziness, problems with vision,
hearing, numbness in feet, memory, confusion, foot pain, inaccessible
telephones.

Hazards at home can include stairways, furniture, clutter, worn carpets,
sliding throw rugs, waxed/wet floors, inaccessible tub/shower stall, and
pets underfoot. Have a safety plan -- think ahead, look around to remove
or replace hazards, consider medical alerts, plan what you will do if
you fall. Call 911!
