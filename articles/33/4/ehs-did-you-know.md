Did you know that sometime in the early 1860's, the circus came to
Eastford? Posters and pictures were hung all over town in anticipation
of this special event! When the Great Van Amburgh Circus marched into
town, Warren Keith was one of the boys who followed the parade around
the town. "I remember the lady sitting in a chair in a cage with lions
and tigers," he said. The "lady" Warren saw in the cage was likely Isaac
A. Van Amburgh. Van Amburgh, an animal trainer, was the first to
introduce jungle acts to the circus. He is also credited with being the
first man ever to put his head into the mouth of a lion earning him the
title, "The Lion King." Van Amburgh wore his hair in a longer style and
often wore togas in his act. This is probably why young Warren thought
he saw a "lady" in the cage. The Van Amburgh name continued to be used
by circuses until 1922, long after Isaac's death in 1865 due to a heart
attack. The Historical Society seeks community support in continuing its
mission of collecting, preserving, and sharing documents, photos, and
artifacts that help to tell the stories of Eastford's unique history.
