Happy New Year!

What kind of new(er) or rejuvenated eco-choices can you make in 2025?
Here are a few eco-actions to get you back in the groove of living a
more planet-friendly lifestyle.

For February, and in the fun of Valentine's Day, bring back the trend of
making your own greeting cards out of art supplies around your home.

For March, and in line with [World Water Day (March 22)](https://www.unwater.org/our-work/world-water-day), chose to
conserve even more water at work and at home.

For April, joining in on the energy of [Earth Day (April 22)](https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2025/), plan to add
more pollinator-friendly plants to your spring garden(s).
