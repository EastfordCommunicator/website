title: Legislative Update
author: State Sen. Jeff Gordon

The Legislative Session in Harford has started, and it is already busy.
There are many pressing and big issues for us to attend to, such as
crafting a new, two-year state budget; keeping the state on an even keel
with its spending and financial status; not increasing taxes; paying
down billions in debt; supporting our towns such as Eastford; stopping
the state from taking control from you about zoning decisions in
Eastford; smartly investing in expanding housing affordability;
promoting work force development; increasing support for public
education; creating wise and affordable energy and climate policies;
supporting local health care services; helping law enforcement, fire
services, and emergency medical services; and much more.

We must do more to make Connecticut more affordable for more people,
reduce our sky-high electric bills, further cut taxes, make our
communities safer, protect local decision-making of land use zoning in
our towns, defend all our rights and medical freedoms for everyone, and
do what we can do realistically to make a better future for all in
Connecticut.

Some items are 1.) Providing tax credits for working families; 2.)
Updating last year's law about property tax exemptions for 100-percent
disabled veterans; 3.) Fixing Connecticut's energy policy and high
electricity/energy costs; 4.) Working on housing affordability; 5.) Work
force development and training; and 6.) Protecting and improving health
care. I have a number of serious proposals on these issue that if passed
can help people in the district and throughout the state.

Three exciting initiatives I am working on are to create 1.) A $500 tax
credit for each child 17 years or younger, and for household dependents
(for example, an adult disabled child declared as a dependent on a
parent's income tax form); 2.) A $500 tax credit for family caregivers
of seniors to help cover their costs; and 3.) An up to $675 tax credit
for family caregivers of disabled veterans. Other states are doing
these. I believe the time is now for Connecticut to do the same.

I am serving as the Ranking Senator on both the Planning & Development
Committee and on the Veterans & Military Affairs Committee. I am also
continuing to serve on the Appropriations, Public Health, and Public
Safety & Security Committees. I look forward to remaining Co-Chair of
the Rural Caucus and being Co-Chair of the Sportsmen Caucus.

Stay tuned for information about my in-person and virtual office hours.
I maintain an open-door policy. As always, please reach out to me if I
can help you with a constituent service, answer a question, or take up a
concern. You can call my office at (860) 240-800, e-mail me at

Thank you again for the opportunity to be your State Senator. I look
forward to all we can do together to help Eastford, the Senate district,
and our state.
