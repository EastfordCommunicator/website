The new year has brought new faces to the library and we are so
grateful. Our hope is to spread not only our love of reading, but our
love for this community as well. These aspirations really coincide with
all the things we will be celebrating here at the library during the
next couple of months. So please, stop in. Jennifer and I look forward
to seeing each and every one of you!

"The Friends of the Eastford Public Library wish to thank everyone who
helped make our inaugural Holiday Fair a huge success. We appreciate the
volunteers who helped set up and break down the event, all those who
donated the lovely silent auction baskets, handmade craft items,
wreaths, and baked goods. The support from our Library Board and our
wonderful patrons was truly humbling."--Nancy Conlan, President
