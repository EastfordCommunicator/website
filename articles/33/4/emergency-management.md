In 2017, the towns of Eastford, Brooklyn, and Pomfret, and The American
Red Cross and the Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and
Homeland Security entered into an agreement to provide an efficient and
effective way to provide sheltering to residents in their communities.

This shelter was one of the first multijurisdictional shelters in
Connecticut. This shelter will be located at the Strong Field House at
Pomfret School in Pomfret. The shelter is non-discriminatory and will
strive to meet the needs of all residents.

The shelter will provide sheltering, including three meals a day. Health
professionals will be on site; however, each individual will be
responsible for bringing their own medications and necessary equipment.
Cots will be provided but each resident is responsible for bringing
personal care items, baby supplies, including formula, food and diapers,
and sleeping accessories (pillows, blankets, sleeping bags).

At the consensus of Emergency Management directors in each participating
town, the shelter will be opened in the event of widespread emergency.
Information regarding shelter opening will be on the [Town of Eastford's website](https://www.eastfordct.gov/), 
the [Town of Eastford Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/townofeastfordct/), and WINY Radio (1350 AM and
97.1 FM) and WILI radio (1400 AM and 95.3 FM).

This shelter will be staffed by Red Cross volunteers, but we need
volunteers to support the American Red Cross at the shelter and if there
is a widespread emergency in Eastford. If you are interested, please
send an email to [emd@townofeastfordct.com](mailto:emd@townofeastfordct.com).
