The Eastford Grove Cemetery Association greatly appreciates the
following donors who have contributed to the beautification of the
grounds: Linda Torgeson, Mary Bloom, Juli Shamback, in memory of Lewis
"Chuck" Shamback. Donations are tax-deductible and can be mailed to:

EGCA, Inc. P.O. Box 284, Eastford, CT 06242.

The Trustees will conduct a general clean-up of the cemetery grounds
after March 15, on a date to be determined. Seasonal flowers, wreathes,
logs and other objects will be removed at the time of the clean-up. If
you wish to recycle your own decorations, you should do so at your
earliest convenience, but prior to the 15th of March.

After March 15, live flowers may be planted or placed in plastic pots
within 12" of the base of the monument; artificial flowers, ornaments,
and other objects are not allowed and will be removed because the
objects are a risk to the groundskeepers and their machines.

A Trustees meeting will be held Tuesday, March 11, at 7 p.m., at the Ivy
Glenn.

Board of Corporators Annual Meeting will be held Wednesday, April 2, at
7 p.m., at the Town Office Building.
