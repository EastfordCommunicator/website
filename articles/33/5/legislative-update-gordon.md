I enjoyed the Cupcake Wars event hosted by the Congregational Church of
Eastford. Great community spirit, which Eastford is well known for. My
baking skills are far eclipsed by what I saw the kids make for wonderful
and delicious cupcakes.

In February, I joined First Selectman Deb Richards and met with Tony
Tiemann and his wife, Laura. Tony is 92 years "young" and a Korean War
veteran. Thank you to Tony and our veterans for your service. It is
appreciated and remembered.

The legislative session is in full swing. Lots of committee meetings and
public hearings. There are many big issues, especially creating a new,
two-year state budget while keeping the state on an even keel with its
spending, not increasing taxes, and paying down the billions of dollars
in state debt. The Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, is
holding many public hearings. I have been hearing from many people
throughout the 35th State Senate District. Let me know your thoughts,
comments, concerns, and ideas.

Recently, the Legislature voted to provide an extra \$40 million to
municipalities to cover for this current fiscal year some of the
escalating costs of special education. The state does not cover 100
percent of the costs. I am working in a bipartisan way to get the state
to do more, including a better and more fair formula for education costs
sharing grants for public schools, otherwise towns must pay (via
property taxes).

We also must do more to make Connecticut more affordable for more
people. A major bill I co-introduced is aimed at reducing in the
short-term our sky-high electric bills and in the long-term create
affordable and sustainable energy policies. The Energy & Technology
Committee took up the bill and there was a long public hearing on it.

As the Ranking Senator on the Planning & Development Committee, I
continue to fight for protecting your right to local decision-making
about what happens in Eastford. I am happy that my bill to get more
state funding for municipal and regional infrastructure projects is
moving forward.

Two other bills of mine have generated growing support: 1) A child tax
credit, and 2) a family caregiver tax credit. I am optimistic that the
Legislature will pass both in some forms.

I serve as the Ranking Senator on both the Planning & Development
Committee and on the Veterans & Military Affairs Committee. I serve on
the Appropriations, Public Health, and Public Safety & Security
Committees. I am a co-chair of the Rural Caucus and the Sportsmen
Caucus.

matter, answer a question, or take up a concern. You can call my office
