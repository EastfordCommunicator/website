title: Cupcake Wars delights the taste buds at CCE
---

EASTFORD --- The 7th Annual Cupcake Wars celebrated sweet success on
Saturday, Feb. 15.

This free community outreach event was hosted by the Congregational
Church of Eastford (CCE) and held in the Eastford Elementary School
gymnasium. This year's competition was comprised of 16 contestants along
with many attendees from the local communities.

Showcasing their baking skills (recipe contest), and decorating talents
(display contest), each contestant's cupcake was judged by our respected
local representatives: Holly Singleton (Woodstock Academy); Sheryl Spink
(Eastford Independent Fire Co.); Lynn Fontaine (Ashford School); and
Susan Welshman (Eastford Town Hall). Attendees of Cupcake Wars sampled
and voted for their favorites in the People's Choice Awards.

Confections of the day ranged from chocolate, apple filling, black
cherry vanilla, peanut butter, strawberry, lemon, mint, banana, toffee,
caramel, cr√®me brule and so much more. There was something to tempt
every pallet.

The event's fun included cupcake tasting, playing Cupcake War's Bingo,
Pin the Cherry on the Cupcake and receiving a crocheted cupcake hat or
keychain donated by the CCE's Women's ministry as a door prize.

Our 2025 Cupcake Wars winners were divided into two categories, Juniors
(13 years and under) and Seniors (14 years and up).
