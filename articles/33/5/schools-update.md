It's spring! The spring equinox, or the first day of spring, was March
20 at 5:01 a.m., the moment the sun crossed the celestial equator.
Although robins may be around all winter, my first sighting of a robin
and the tiny yellow and purple crocuses pushing their way up through the
dark winter landscape, signal that spring, the season of rebirth and
renewal, is near.

In schools, spring is the time not only for planning a positive ending
for the current school year but for beginning to plan for the next
school year.

At Eastford Elementary:

- Students in grades 3-8 will begin SBAC testing toward the end of April
and through the month of May. Students in grades 5 and 8 will also take
the NGSS assessment during this testing window.
- With the support of our school counselor Stephanie Schleicher,
students in grade 8 have selected the high school they will attend:
Woodstock Academy (12); E.O. Smith (6); Ellis Tech (3); and Killingly
Agricultural Program (1).
- Grade 8 students are preparing for their trip to Washington D.C. on
June 3-6 with Jennifer Barlow, Catherine DePercio and four parent
volunteers.
- We are accepting both kindergarten and preschool registrations. [Please
check our school website for the proper registration
forms](https://www.eastfordct.org/). All registrations should be submitted to the school office by the
end of April.

At its February meeting our BOE approved:

- The 2025-26 school calendar
- The 2025-26 school budget of $4,932,677, a 6.99-percent increase over
the 2024-25 school budget.
- The updated 2025-26 Capital Plan
- The submission of the Mckinney Vento Homeless Assistance Grant

At its March meeting, the BOE reviewed the request from the Board of
Selectmen to reduce the BOE budget in response to the town starting the
2025-26 budget process by almost 8 percent in the red due to state cuts
in funding and mandates for motor vehicle and veteran abetments. Being a
BOE member carries with it the dual responsibility of supporting the
best educational programming for the students of Eastford while
maintaining a trusted collaborative relationship with the Board of
Selectmen and the taxpayers of Eastford. Our town has always responded
positively to the requests of the BOE, and it is in that spirt of
collaboration that our BOE voted to submit a revised 2025-2026 Board of
Education budget of $4,794,179, an increase of 3.99 percent over the
2024-2025 budget, to the Board of Selectmen.

Our BOE takes their responsibilities to the community of Eastford and
the education of our students seriously. Given March is the month
officially set aside to recognize the volunteer spirit and dedicated
efforts of BOE members, I would like to recognize our BOE members and
the 47 years of collected service that our current BOE members have
dedicated to supporting the Eastford Community of Learners --- Robert
Ellsworth (13), Steven Bowen (11), Terry Cote (7), Adam Minor (5),
Jessica Perry (5), Lauren Barlow (3), and Michael Bilica (3).

All notices of scholarships we receive, including those for high school
students, are posted on our website. We recently posted the New England
Service Scholarships, offered by the Red Sox Foundation. This program
recognizes 100 high school seniors who have demonstrated a commitment to
community service and academic excellence. [Details are available on their website](https://www.redsoxfoundation.org/servicescholarships/).

Since 1983, the Community Foundation has awarded over $11.9 million in
scholarships from 136 funds established by generous individuals,
families, businesses and nonprofit to help area students pursue an
education and rewarding careers. [Details are available on their website]https://cfect.org/.

It is my hope that all members of the Eastford community take advantage
of the opportunity to embrace the spring spirit of rebirth and renewal.
