title: Scramble Predicts Early Spring
---

EASTFORD --- It's not Groundhog Day in Eastford --- it's Duck Day!

In what long ago became an annual tradition in town, Scramble the Duck
announced its annual meteorological prediction on Sunday, Feb. 2, at the
Ivy Glenn Memorial in a ceremony that braved single-digit temperatures.

According to Scramble, as he communicated to his handlers, Benjamin
Torcellini and Aaron Minor, Eastford will see relief from these cold
temperatures, as there will be an early spring!

Torcellini's opening speech gave a summary of why Scramble's work is
so important.

"The weather in New England is something special, something that cannot
be predicted by a furry rodent who rarely even looks at the weather," he
said. "This is why a new critter came to the stage, to perhaps save the
people of the New England corridor from a possible winter catastrophe."

While groundhogs may not be very accurate, Scramble can boast
100-percent accuracy. After Scramble examined the meteorological
conditions, he asked his handlers to read a scroll containing his
prediction. In the scroll read by Minor, Scramble forecasted early
spring weather, noting the meaningful absence of a shadow that points to
an early spring. The scroll read:

> "Hark, good folk, both far and near,\
> Gather close and lend an ear.\
> For lo, this morn, a duck so fair,\
> Did quack with tidings through the air.\
> Scramble, the duck of feath'ry down,\
> At Ivy Glenn, told truth to the town:\
> "Mark ye well, the time draws nigh,\
> When winter's grasp shall fade and die.\
> No more the frost shall bite thine hand,\
> Nor icy winds o'er Eastford's land.\
> The snow shall melt, the buds shall bloom,\
> And banish forth the winter's gloom.\
> Six weeks less of winter's reign,\
> The earth shall wake, no chill remain.\
> The brooks shall sing, the meadows green,\
> And spring's fair promise shall be seen."\
> Eastford did cheer, their hearts took flight,\
> At Scramble's quack, so bold and bright.\
> No prophet more could they request,\
> Than he who predicts the weather's best.\
> So behold, the duck his wisdom bring,\
> For Scramble speaks of early spring.\
> Let flowers rise, let seed take wing,\
> And all the world with gladness sing!"\

After his prediction, State Sen. Jeff Gordon and State Rep. Pat Boyd
thanked Scramble for his service to the community, awarding him a
citation for his efforts.
