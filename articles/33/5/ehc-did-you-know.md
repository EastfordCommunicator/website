The train station in Abington (which is part of Pomfret) was the closest
rail station to Eastford. Farmers took their crops and milk to Abington
to move them to larger markets and vehicles were delivered from the
railroad to Bowen's Garage and Bowen's Trucking over the years. You
could also go east to Boston or southwest to New York and beyond. In the
1890's, there was talk of a rail link from Willimantic to Southbridge,
Mass., passing though Eastford, but it was never built. Abington Station
was located along what is now the Air Line Rail Trail, across the street
from Pomfret Town Hall, just south of the bridge overpass on Route 44.
