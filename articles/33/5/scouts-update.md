EASTFORD/ASHFORD --- Scouts enjoyed a Ski trip to Ski Sundown on Feb. 2.
Those that were novices started out with a ski lesson. Troop 92 Scouts
had a great time skiing. Several Scouts had a goal of skiing every trail
on the mountain. Several scouts tried skiing or snowboarding for the
first time and learned a new sport, and others saw improvement in their
skills. Those that were competent at turning were able to earn the Snow
Sports Merit Badge.

Scouts participated in earning the Scouting Heritage Merit Badge. One
session covered Troop 92 history highlights and badges, and another
session was at the Scout Museum where they saw a presentation by John
DiVenere from Troop 15 in Tolland explaining the origin of scouting.
Scouts then participated in traditional Scout competitive games.

Thursday, May 15 is a deadline for Summer Camp payment of $550. After
that, it goes up to $585. Summer Camp for Troop 92 will be July 27-Aug
1.

There is a big initiative this year by the Council to fundraise for
Camperships. They want every Scout to have the opportunity to have the
summer camp experience and not be discouraged because of the fee to
attend camp. If anyone personally or their business/company wants to
donate $500/summer camp or $250/Cub day camp, the donation will help
scouts all over the Council. Donations can be made to Connecticut Rivers
Council at ctscouting.org. Click on "Support" and then "Camp4All." Help
send a scout to camp!

The Cub Scouts recently sold meat sticks and fire starters at the
transfer station and raised $528.48. We want to thank the many people
who supported us!

We were able to attend an overnight at the EcoTarium in Worcester. We
learned about nocturnal animals, dissected owl pellets, and traveled
through the universe by watching a video in the Planetarium.

The Cub Scouts held their annual Pinewood Derby competition on Saturday,
March 8. This features homemade gravity powered racecars. This
competition was as much fun as it always is! Here are the final results:
Overall Pack Champion, Callen; Most Fuel Efficient, Joey; Original Car
Design, Corbin; Judge's Choice, Victor; Alumni Race Winner, Doug.

In February the Troop:
- Did a suicide prevention and awareness class for older scouts
- Practiced the EDGE method with knots (Explain, Demonstrate, Guide, Enable)
- Learned, and then taught others basic knots
- Discussed hiking safety while in the outdoors.
- Had an Order of the Arrow election. Ryker, Henry, and Cooper were
voted in. The Order of the Arrow is a service organization within
scouting.

In March, scouts were concentrating on training required for rank
advancement. Topics included first aid, weather requirements for hiking,
and compass work.

Planning has started for the Mother's Day Flower Sale in May. This is a
major fundraiser for the Troop. On April 5, Merit Badge Madness will be
held at Xavier High School. No scout meeting on April 8. On April 22,
Summer Camp fees are due. Cost is $560. Planning for campout at JNW. On
April 25-27, camp out at JN Webster for Compass and GPS instructions,
and cooking.

Scout meetings are second and last Tuesdays of the month at St Philip's
Rec Center at 6:30 p.m. New members are welcome. Scouts learn
leadership, teamwork and communication, as well as outdoor skills and
fellowship.

April 1 is April Fool's Day. Look out for tricks!
