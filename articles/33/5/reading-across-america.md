EASTFORD --- Some of the Eastford Elementary School students celebrated
Read Across America on March 4 by reading stories to READ (Reading
Education Assistant Dogs). The students read to the registered therapy
dogs -- Millie, Willow and Cora (pictured). As a bonus for their great
job, reading students received stickers and pencils, and the dogs
enjoyed petting and hugs and got to listen to some wonderful reading!
