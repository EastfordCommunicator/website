The Eastford Food Pantry is looking for individuals or families who
reside in Eastford and are in
need of food assistance. If you need help with acquiring food call
Audrey Carabeau at
(860) 933-7685 to sign up. We have the resources to help you. All
referrals are kept confidential.

Delivery is available to those who are homebound.

The Eastford Food Pantry is located at the Eastford Baptist Church, 133
Union Rd., and open
the first Monday of each month from 8-11 a.m. We will also be open on
April 16 from 2 to
4 p.m. to distribute hams for Easter dinner.

Thank you to all who donated food, money, and gift cards for our
families. We recently
received a large donation of home goods, as well as dog food, which is
greatly appreciated.

The Eastford Food Pantry relies on donations from the community. All
donations to the pantry
can be dropped off at the Town Office Building during regular business
hours. Check donations
can be mailed to Eastford Food Pantry, 16 Westford Rd., Eastford, CT
06242.

This month we are asking for donations of crackers, nuts, granola bars
and breakfast bars to
replenish our shelves.

Thank you for your support!
