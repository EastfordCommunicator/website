The **Renter's Relief program** will begin April 1 and
will run through October 1st. You will need proof of rent payments and
utilities paid in the 2024 calendar year.

## Motor vehicle adjustments

In order to have a motor vehicle bill adjusted we need
**two** forms of proof because the tax is a car tax not a
road tax.

-   The first is a copy of your motor vehicle plate return receipt
-   The second is something proving you got rid of the vehicle. For a
    list of accepted proofs look on the assessor's website or call the
    office.
-   If you traded a vehicle and **kept the same plate** do not bring us
    any documentation because DMV will automatically process the
    adjustments.

## Income and Expense Forms

Connecticut General Statute 12-63c requires all owners of rental real
property to annually file an Income and Expense form with the Assessor's
Office by June 1st. **The information filed and furnished with this
report will remain confidential and is not open to public
inspection.** Any information related to the actual rental and operating
expenses shall not be a public record and is
not subject to the provisions of Section 1-19 (Freedom of
Information) of the Connecticut General Statutes. All properties that
are rented or leased, including commercial, retail, industrial, land and
residential properties, except "*such property used for residential
purposes, containing not more than six dwelling units and in which the
owner* *resides*" must file and in the case of a non-residential
property that is partially rented and partially owner-occupied.

In accordance with Section 12-63c(d), of the Connecticut General
Statutes, as amended, any owner of rental real property who fails to
file this form or files an incomplete or false form with intent to
defraud, shall be subject to a penalty assessment equal to a **Ten
Percent (10%) increase** in the assessed value of such property.

## Quadrennial Filing

CGS 12-81, (7), (10), (11), (16) and 12-87 require the filing of a tax
exempt return for seeking property tax status either new or any
additional property. Due no later than November 1, 2025.

The Assessor's Office is open Tuesday 4:30-7:30pm and Friday. The
telephone number is 860-974-1291.
