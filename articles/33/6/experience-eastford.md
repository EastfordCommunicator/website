EASTFORD --- On Saturday, May 10, a flurry of activity came to Eastford
Elementary School, as the Recreation Commission hosted its annual
"Experience Eastford" event, a time of food, vendors, games, music, and
exhibits for all ages. Food was provided by Hungry Lion, an
Eastford-based company, while ice cream was provided by Megan Budd for a
donation to the Congregational Church of Eastford (CCE) Fire Fund. Music
was provided by the Babcock Cornet Band and the praise and worship team
from CCE (otherwise known as the "B-Sides.")
