title: Scouts spring into packed summer schedule
---
EASTFORD/ASHFORD --- The "Merit Badge Madness" event was held at Xavier
High School and was attended by Ryker, Henry, John, Conner, and Mason.

The Cub Scouts made first aid kits for their hiking bags. They learned
about what to do in the event of an emergency. Over spring break, the
Scouts went to see a Yard Goats game and spent the night on the
outfield.

Summer Camp fees were recently collected. Cost is $560, which
represents the "Early Bird" price. JNW has an initiative to send any
Scout to Camp. If anyone would like to donate money to send a Scout to
Camp, talk to Rob H. or Bob Z.

National Youth Leadership Training will be held Aug. 3-9. It was agreed
that the Troop would like to send at least one senior Scout to JNW for a
week at \$410, which would be paid for by the troop. The Scout must be
committed to a leadership role in the Scouts and be First Class or
above. Eligible: Henry, John, Ryker, Landon, Noah.

May was busy! On Saturday, May 10, we held a Mother's Day flower sale.
At our May 13 meeting, Scouts got instructions in food preparation, and
a class on knife sharpening. On May 16-18, we had a campout and climb at
Mt. Monadnock, in Jaffry, N.H. On May 23-24, the Troop placed flags in
the cemeteries prior to Memorial Day.

Last month, the Cub Scouts took a hike at Tinkerville Brook Preserve.
They learned about different plants and animals. Tinkerville Brook
hiking trail in Ashford is part of Joshua's Trust land conservancy. They
also discussed and practiced leave no trace principles. The Cubs also
attended a campout at JNW and participated in their Fishing Derby.

Upcoming Events:
- July 27-Aug. 1: Summer Camp at Camp JN Webster Scout Reservation in
Ashford.
- Aug. 3-9: National Youth Leadership Training. Eligible: Henry, John,
Ryker, Landon, Noah.
- Aug. 21-24: Brooklyn Fair Parking fundraiser.
- Next year: Bike trip in the fall.

Scouts learn leadership, teamwork, and communication, as well as outdoor
skills and fellowship.

New members are welcome. Meetings are on the second and last Tuesday of
the month at 6:30 p.m. at St Philip's Rec Hall in Ashford.
