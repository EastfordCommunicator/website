Did you know that in 1872, the farm at the top of Sumner Hill Road was
owned by a man named A.B. Yetter? Mr. Yetter was a New York City
truckman who owned many horse-drawn vehicles. When his horses became
lame or footsore from navigating the cobblestone streets of the city,
they were shipped to the Abington Rail Station. They were then brought
to Eastford, where they were allowed to rest and recuperate on Yetter's
farm. After a restorative stay on Yetter Hill the horses were shipped
back to the city and returned to service. The farm also provided baled
hay for the horses that Yetter shipped to New York from the Abington
Station.

Join us on June 19 for a brief business meeting followed by a slide show
presentation on the Air Line Trail by Phil Finch. Refreshments will be
served.

The Florence Warren Museum of Eastford History opened on May 18 and will
be open every second and fourth Sunday through the month of October.
Please pay us a visit!
