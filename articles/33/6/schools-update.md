June, a time of endings and beginnings. For eighth-grade students, their
graduation on June 12 marks the end of their years at Eastford
Elementary School. For everyone, June 21 signals the first day of
summer. In celebration of the ending of another great school year and
the beginning of summer, I share this thought: "And so with the sunshine
and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees ... I had the
familiar conviction that life was beginning all over again with the
summer." (F. Scott Fitzgerald)

As with leaves bursting on trees, the ending of the school year is
filled with its own bursts of renewed activity. Grade 8 students are
preparing for their trip to Washington D.C. on June 3-6. Teachers are
planning their final lessons and students are enjoying outside
activities and end-of-year field trips with their friends. The Board of
Education (BOE) is busy assessing, approving and overseeing facility
needs that must be addressed in preparation for a new school year. In
addition, at their April and May meetings, the BOE:

- Voted to comply with the Connecticut Nutrition Standards during the
period of July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026.
- Set the date for the end of the school year as June 13 for students
and June 16 for staff.
- Set the graduation date for June 12.
- Accepted several new policies to be consistent with recent legislative
changes.
- Allowed the administration to move forward in utilizing the Putnam
YMCA as our before- and after-school provider.
- Supported the Scholarship Committee's recommendations regarding the
Ethel Cushing Gardner Music Scholarships as well as the scholarships
provided through the Community Foundation of Eastern Connecticut.

The state is also launching new initiatives. One initiative that is
important that all community members become familiar with is Early Start
CT, a new, state-funded early care and education program that\'s
targeted to start on July 1, 2025. Early Start combines 3 existing
programs: Child Day Care Contracts, School Readiness Grants, and State
Head Start Supplement Grants, into 1 new program. Early Start CT
requires the formation of local governance partnerships (LGP). Districts
are encouraged to form LGPs that include membership from more than one
town. LGPs bring community stakeholders together to:

- Assess the early childhood needs of families;
- Implement strategies, share resources, and engage the community in
improving the well-being and development of children;
- Improve access to high-quality early childcare and education
programming;
- Increase family engagement by connecting families with early childhood
services and programming.

will be provided in in upcoming issues of the *Communicator* and in
administrative reports to the BOE.

Nelson Mandela said, "Education is the most powerful weapon which you
can use to change the world." As we transition from the ending of one
school year to the beginning of another, I once again thank the Eastford
community for providing our students with high-quality access to the
power of education. As always, please do not hesitate to contact me to
share ideas, questions or concerns about the programs, protocols and
processes of the Eastford School District, at dleake@eastfordct.org.
Enjoy the summer!
