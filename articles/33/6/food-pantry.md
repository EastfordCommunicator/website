The Eastford Food Pantry, located at the Eastford Baptist Church, 133
Union Rd., is pleased to announce that we are now open twice monthly. Please see our hours of
operation for the next few months at the end of this article.

We continue to seek individuals or families who reside in Eastford and
are in need of food assistance. If you need help with acquiring food, call Audrey Carabeau
at (860) 933-7685 to sign up. We have the resources to help you! All referrals are kept
confidential. Delivery is available to those who are homebound.

Thank you to all who donated food and money so that we can provide for
our pantry families.

The Eastford Food Pantry relies on donations from the community. All
donations to the pantry can be dropped off at our new drop off location, Bowen's Garage, or at
the Town Office Building during regular business hours. Check donations can be mailed to
Eastford Food Pantry, 16 Westford Rd., Eastford, CT 06242.

Donation suggestions include peanut butter, macaroni and cheese, pasta
sauce, and tuna.

Thank you for your support!
