EASTFORD --- The Pomfret/Eastford Little League (PELL) hosted a cleanup
at Bowen Memorial Field on Saturday, April 19. The field is one of two
fields (the other is at 63 Hampton Rd., Pomfret Center) that PELL uses
for their games. Clean-up work on April 19 included a complete tilling
of the infield, as well as landscaping around the outfield fence. Pizza
was provided for volunteers by State Sen. Jeff Gordon.
