EASTFORD --- The sun shone brightly on Monday, May 26, as Eastford
gathered for its annual Memorial Day Parade and Ceremony, which honored
local veterans for their sacrifices to make our freedoms possible. The
festivities began with memorial services and military salutes at General
Lyon Cemetery and Grove Cemetery. Residents then gathered at the
Eastford Elementary School parking lot, and commenced the short parade
at 9:30 a.m., which began on John Perry Road, before turning on Old
Colony Road and finishing at the Ivy Glenn Memorial, where a short
ceremony followed thereafter.
