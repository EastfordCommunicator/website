EASTFORD --- Eastford Baptist Church and the Congregational Church of
Eastford joined forces on Sunday, April 6, conducting a Roadside Cleanup
Day from 1-3 p.m., which was a success thanks to nearly 50 volunteers.
In total, 15 miles of road were cleaned up, filling three pickup trucks
to capactiy. Fun finds included a tire, a toilet, a bowling ball, a full
loaf of bread, a bollard, some sheet metal ductwork, a wind chime, and a
chair leg. Many thanks to Mansfield Supply for donations of trash bags.
The Congregational Church of Eastford provided a kickoff hot dog lunch,
while Eastford Baptist Church provided ice cream for volunteers after
the cleanup.
