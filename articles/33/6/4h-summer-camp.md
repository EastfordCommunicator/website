title: Summer camp spots filling up fast at 4-H
---
POMFRET --- Summer is our favorite time of the year!

Camp at the Windham-Tolland 4-H Camp starts on June 22 this year and
ends on Aug. 15. Family camp runs from Aug. 15 at 7 p.m., until Aug. 16
at 5 p.m. We offer both day and overnight camp and each week of camp has
a different theme. [You can find details and registration forms on our
website](https://4hcampct.org/).

Campers self-select the activities they want to put into their schedule
each week from a list of 13 offerings. Each year we recruit counselors
from other countries to enrich camper experiences. This year we have
already recruited counselors from England, Scotland, Poland, Germany,
Australia, New Zealand, Nambia, and South Africa. Week 6 is
International Week and these counselors get to share information and
cuisine from their countries at an International Fair with campers that
week.

Registration is open through the summer, but slots are already filling
up quickly, especially for day camp, and you may find the week you want
to be full if you wait too long to sign up.

For more information, contact Windham-Tolland 4-H Camp, 326 Taft Pond
Rd., Pomfret Center, at (860) 974-1122 or [visit the camp website](https://4hcampct.org/).
