Members recently toured the Eastford Baptist Church to familiarize
ourselves with the layout of the facility.

We responded to 19 emergencies in February and 27 emergencies in March.
Members participated in the annual roadside clean-up event, and drilled
pumping skills on all trucks.

- Drill: What is the purpose of conducting pumping drills annually? The
purpose of frequent drills is essential for ensuring fire safety and
preparedness. The drills help ensure that the fire suppression system is
fully operational and ready to respond during an emergency. In addition,
practicing the skills on all trucks that provide water is an important
part for the firemen to feel comfortable with the trucks' operation.

- EMS Drill: Members were FIT tested for N95 masks. This testing is
critical to ensure a proper seal and effective protection with no air
leaks. OSHA mandated testing is required annually following protocols,
and/or changes in the user, i.e., facial surgery, weight gain/loss,
dental work, etc. Records must be kept on file until the next scheduled
fitting and testing.

The season for brush fires is here in full force. A brush fire is a fire
in vegetation that is less than 6-feet tall, such as grasses, brush and
trees. A brush fire is difficult to control and often spreads quickly,
fueled by oxygen and wind. Brush fires can start by burning leaves,
garbage or brush, that if left unattended, can lead to uncontrolled
wildfires. Most fires start by human activities such as unattended
campfires, cigarettes and arson, along with natural causes including
lightning strikes. Four out of five wildfires are started by people, but
dry weather, drought and strong winds can create the perfect disaster.

Why do we train? Every fire behaves differently. Firefighters must learn
a wide range of suppression tactics from basic control line to hot
spotting. Pictured, EIFC members conducted brush fire training on Church
Road on April 9.

How can people avoid brush fires? Clear debris and be aware of dry
vegetation, hanging branches and trash. Keep flammable items far away
and have water nearby, pay attention to weather and drought conditions.
Build campfires in an open location, douse the campfire and stir until
cold, keep running vehicles and equipment off dry grass. Do not operate
equipment or let stand running that may produce sparks near vegetation.

Remember, not all fire is bad! Fire plays a natural and necessary role
in many landscapes and vital for some wildlife habitation. The recipe
for the successful end of a working campfire is 
1.  Douse with a large
bucket of water
2.  Stir
3. Add another bucket of water
4. Stir again.

As Smokey the Bear says: "Only you can prevent forest fires."
