Celebrate summer with the environment in mind! Picnic with reusable
plates and utensils. Encourage friends to bring refillable water bottles
to fill at the tap for playdates/parties. Skip plastic whenever and
wherever you can. Make celebratory glitter/confetti out of natural tree
leaves. Recycle and properly dispose of any materials you use. Be
mindful of any posted guidance when hiking or boating.

Happy summer!
