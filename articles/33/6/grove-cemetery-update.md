The Eastford Grove Cemetery Association is committed to helping families
with their decisions regarding plot purchase and size of plot as it
pertains to burial wishes. It is with this in mind that the Association
is offering its assistance to you whether you are making plans for
yourself or for a loved one. The decisions you may face are more complex
than most people realize and are usually not done easily when people are
grieving. Our board can confidentially aid you in considering various
plot options for full and cremation burials, memorial (flush) markers
and monuments. Feel free to call for an appointment at (860) 428-0280.
The EGCA is a non-profit organization.

Reminder: During mowing season, March 15 to Thanksgiving, only live
flowers may be planted, or placed in plastic pots, within 12 inches of
the base of the monument. All artificial flowers and ornaments are
prohibited during the mowing season and will be removed.
