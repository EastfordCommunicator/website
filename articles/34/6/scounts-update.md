Happy New Year, everyone!

December was a slow month for Scouts because of the holiday season. The
Troop had a Court of Honor to award the many Merit Badges that have been
earned by the Scouts. Four Scouts were advanced in rank.

- Coming Up: Ski trip at Ski Sundown on Sunday, Jan. 4. This will be a
day trip.

- Spring Trip: Potential orienteering trip to Stone's Ranch Military
Reserve, in East Lyme. Possibly March or April. Scouts will learn
compass skills and navigation at a camp out there. End of the year wrap
up trip is still being discussed. High adventure!

Last month the Cub Scouts participated in their annual Rain Gutter
Regatta. The cubs built and painted their small sail boats. They
propelled their boats down the inflatable water filled race track by
blowing air into the sail through a straw.

Upcoming Cub Scout events include an overnight at the New England Air
Museum and our annual Pinewood Derby. Cub Scout meetings are the first
Friday of the month at Knowlton Memorial Hall at 6 p.m. New members are
welcome. Troop meetings are on the second and fourth Tuesday of the
month at St. Philip's Recreation Center. New members are welcome.
