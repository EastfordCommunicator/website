The winter weather season has arrived. With it comes one of the most
exciting messages a student can receive --- no school today due to snow
or ice-covered roads.

In Eastford, for closings or delays, due to busing schedules, we
generally follow the decision of Woodstock Academy. Making a
weather-related call is never easy. When the decision is straight
forward, I like to make the announcement the evening before so families
can make plans for the adjusted schedule. If the decision is not clear,
the call may be delayed until the morning.

Occasionally, a snow call may be changed from a delay to a closing.
Changing from a delay to a closing may occur due to changes in the
pattern of the storm, roads that cannot be cleared as quickly as
anticipated, or buses that fail to start. The safety of our students is
the most critical factor in making final decisions. All EES staff and
families receive text, voice and e-mail messages concerning school
closing and other important information.

The weather does not impact the volunteer spirit that permeates the
Eastford community. At EES, we are fortunate to receive volunteer
support from many members of the community. Over the next few months, I
hope to highlight individuals and groups that share their time and
talents to enrich the lives of the students at EES.

Since 2013, volunteers from the Congregational Church of Eastford have
been providing a variety of after-hours experiences for our students,
that include constructing bird houses, playing board games, building
rockets, making crafts, supporting the homework club and one-one
mentoring. Over the years, the time has varied from one to four
afternoons a week, and the number of volunteers has varied from 20-50
individuals per year. These activities benefit not only our students but
also the seniors, as evidenced by statements such as, "I somehow thought
I didn\'t like kids until I started sitting cross-legged on the floor in
the school library playing 'Chutes and Ladders' with littles. Who
couldn\'t fall in love with them?" Or, \"When I was in junior high, I
was all into model rockets. At EES it is such a blessing to have been
able to share that excitement with such fine middle school students."

In other news:

- The application process for the Ethel Cushing Gardner Scholarship is
now open. This is a scholarship open to high school seniors and college
level students who live in Eastford and have a serious interest in
music. Additional information is available on the Eastford School
website.

- The Board of Education met on Dec. 11 and took the following actions:
We welcomed Nancy Neff to her first term; approved the re-appointment of
Stephen Bowen as BOE chairman, Terry Cote as vice chairman and Adam
Minor as secretary; and approved revisions to several policies.

Each new year brings to any community a new set of challenges,
accomplishments, and surprises. I am confident that in 2026 the Eastford
learning community will work together to overcome challenges, celebrate
accomplishments, and hope that all surprises are positive. One of the
first challenges the BOE faces is the development of the 2026-27 budget.
At the Jan. 8 Board of Education meeting, I will present a recommended
budget to the BOE for review at its budget meetings on Jan. 22 and Feb.
3.

All the best for a safe and healthy 2026. As always, never hesitate to
