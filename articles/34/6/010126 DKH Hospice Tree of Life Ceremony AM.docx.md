EASTFORD --- On Sunday, Dec. 7, people from all over northeastern
Connecticut gathered together in 11 different locations to remember lost
family and friends for Day Kimball Healthcare's 36th Annual Hospice Tree
of Life Ceremony.

In Eastford, a gathering was held at the Ivy Glenn Memorial. The other
towns hosting events were Brooklyn, Canterbury, Danielson, Griswold,
Plainfield, Pomfret, Putnam, Sterling, Thompson, Woodstock. In years
past, the tree lighting event has raised about \$35,000 annually to
support hospice and palliative care services in the region. Trees at all
11 locations were decorated with colored lights, which according to DKH,
symbolize "love and hope," helping family and friends to remember loved
ones who have passed away while in hospice care. Each year, Day Kimball
Healthcare offers the purchase of memorial lights on each community\'s
Tree of Life to benefit the work done by Hospice & Palliative Care of
Northeastern Connecticut to enhance the lives of terminally ill patients
and their families.

Eastford's Tree Lighting Ceremony, which was hosted by the
Congregational Church of Eastford (CCE), began with a selection of
Christmas carols. Day Kimball Healthcare Foundation Director of
Development Kristen E. Willis delivered remarks, thanking people for
their support. CCE Pastor Mike Moran delivered the invocation. Hospice
representatives Susan Honeychurch and Ashley Ravenelle also addressed
the crowd, thanking them for supporting hospice and palliative care in
the region. The tree lighting itself was conducted by Justin Loss, in
honor of his grandmother, Helene, who died in December 2024.

"Thank you all again for being here tonight to support these efforts and
more importantly to take time to reflect on the journey of Hospice and
the significance of what has become a community celebration of hope and
healing," Willis said, adding a message from 2025 Tree of Life Chairman
Roger Franklin: "As we gather here, and at the other 10 sites throughout
northeastern Connecticut this evening, we can attest to the
compassionate care a loved one has received. It is for that reason, we
are here not only to remember our loved ones who have passed on, but to
honor those who continue to provide end-of-life care. As we experience
this festive time of year, may we be reminded that those whom we are
here to remember and honor have a very special place in our hearts. For
it is in this same festive spirit that we hope and pray for all people
affected by life threatening diseases. And so, let us remember our loved
ones this evening as we illuminate the Hospice Tree of Life. May we be
reminded too of the compassionate caring and dedication of the Hospice
Team, and may we look forward with hope that someday many dreaded
diseases will be no more."
