To each and every person who donated, volunteered their time, or
attended the Friends of the Eastford Public Library's Holiday Fair in
December --- thank you! It was a resounding success. We are a small-town
library with a big heart and the support from our community allows us to
reach a little further and shine a little brighter. We are truly
grateful.

Our hope in the new year is to continue to offer our beloved patrons a
cozy spot to visit, create, and, of course, grab the perfect read. Stop
in, we'd love to see you.

Library hours are Tuesdays, 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to
5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 12
p.m.

You may reach us at (860) 97 or by e-mail
at <eastfordpublib@gmail.com>. Upcoming events and programs can be seen on
the town page or on social media. If you haven't yet, please
