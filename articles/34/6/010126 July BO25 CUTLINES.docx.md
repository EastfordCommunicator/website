**JULY**

In July, the Congregational Church of Eastford hosted its annual Frog
Jump and Band Concert at Crystal Pond Park on July 12, which included
the fan-favorite \"Cake Walk.\" Meanwhile, the Congregational Church of
Eastford and Living Proof Church of Ashford held its annual Sports Camp
at Eastford Elementary School July 21-25. Down the road, Eastford
Baptist Church held its annual Vacation Bible School July 28-Aug. 1,
which included an appearance by the dastardly \"Grump.\" *File photos*
