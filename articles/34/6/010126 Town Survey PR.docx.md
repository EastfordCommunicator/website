Planning Commission seeks participation in POCD survey

EASTFORD --- The Town of Eastford Planning Commission has begun the
process of updating the town\'s Plan of Conservation & Development
(POCD). The POCD sets the vision for how the town would like to move
forward over the next 10 years.

The Planning Commission is responsible for updating the POCD at a
minimum once every 10 years, as required by state statutes. Eastford\'s
POCD was last updated in 2016 and can be found on the town\'s website.
This update provides an opportunity for the town to consider whether to
make changes in terms of the goals and objectives for the community.

As part of the process, the commission will be conducting a Community
Survey that will be available both online and in print at various
locations throughout town starting Jan. 1, 2026. Scan the survey's QR
code that accompanies this article to participate.

For more information and/or to find out how to get involved, please
