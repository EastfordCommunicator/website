**Did You Know?**

**Eastford Historical Society**

Did you know that *Connecticut Magazine* once named Eastford the number
one town in Connecticut (towns with a population below 4,500) for
"Quality of Life"?

One of the listed attributes of the town was "an excellent school
system." Education was rated on the percentage of local public high
school graduates from the class of 1991 who went on to college, and on
the 1991-1992 Mastery Test results for fourth and eighth graders in math
and language arts.

In other school news, the Student Council voted to purchase a tree to be
planted in place of the beautiful old maple that was destroyed by the
December snowstorm.

The Eastford Historical Society wishes you all a happy, healthy holiday!
