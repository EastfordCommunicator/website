**OCTOBER**

In October, Buell\'s Orchard held a pair of events that brought the
community out to enjoy some family fun. Their annual Trunk or Treat
event was held Oct. 26, featuring more than a dozen trunks for families
to enjoy. Earlier in the month, the orchard held its annual Harvest
Festival on Oct. 11. Meanwhile, the town hosted its annual Trunk or
Treat on Halloween night, Oct. 31, at Eastford Elementary School, which
brought out children and their families to enjoy a myriad of treats.
