How you can help us when we respond to your emergency: The importance of
patient medical information at medical calls cannot be overstated. It is
crucial for healthcare providers to have access to accurate and
up-to-date medical information to provide the best possible care to
patients on scene. Medical information serves as a vital communication
tool that connects patients with healthcare professionals and ensures
that they receive the necessary medical advice and treatment. Gathering
information verbally and in writing by the first responders and
paramedics provide the best possible treatment prior to transport. See
the list below for necessary information:

Name of Patient:

Date of Birth:

Age:

Gender: M/F

Home Address:

Pertinent Past Medical History:

Current Medical History:

Allergies:

Describe Reaction to Allergies:

Medications: (Prescription/Over-the-Counter), Name of Medication, Dose,
Purpose

Recent Surgeries: Procedure, Date

We recommend that the above information be created and filled out in its
entirety, regularly updated, multiple copies made and visibly taped to
the refrigerator door. A copy will be given to the ambulance service,
one to the receiving hospital emergency department and one to be
updated. Having the above readily accessible will enhance our transfer
of critical information.

The fire department responded to 31 "911" emergencies in November. For
fun, we participated in the 26th Annual Dazzle Light Parade on Dec. 7,
in Putnam, brightly lit with colorful lights on an engine tanker.

Welcome to Dan Driscoll as our newest member. Dan will be cross-trained

There is still plenty of time to consider making your annual
tax-deductible charities donation to the EIFC. We, a 100-percent
volunteer organization, rely on the generous annual monetary support we
get from you, the town residents. Finances are tight due to the
escalation of costs to maintain the company functioning and meet
training requirements. Through your generosity, you are helping us make
a difference in your community and help us to sustain a feeling of
personal satisfaction that we get from helping our friends and neighbors
24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Please send your donation to EIFC, P.O.
Box 333, Eastford, CT 06242. You will receive, by return mail, a thank
you showing the amount donated for tax purposes.

The EIFC has accomplished much in 2025. A detailed report will be
provided in January of 2026. Although we are currently small in numbers,
we are strong in our training and call response. We welcome any and all
who wish to be part of our family.
