- The planting of real or artificial trees and shrubs, whether in the
ground or in containers, will not be allowed. Live flowers (annuals or
bulbs) may be planted or placed in plastic pots at the base of the
monument. These plants must not extend more than 12" from the base. On a
single interment space (4' X 9') with a flush marker and in the
Cremation Section of the cemetery, only cut flowers or live, potted
plants will be allowed. Seasonal wreaths, logs, or baskets containing
live or artificial flowers will be allowed from Thanksgiving to March 15.

after March 15 each year. Flowers and seasonal wreathes and logs will be
removed at this time.

ornaments and other objects such as, but not limited to, artificial
flowers, shells, toys, balloons, rocks, metal designs, statues,
