I wish your family and you the best this holiday season and when the new
year starts!

In early February, the legislative session starts up again. It will be a
"short session" of only several months. Yet, a lot is planned and I
expect there will be a whirlwind of activity. Topics of interest will be
adjustments to the state's rainy-day fund and budget, and spending and
taxation policies. These are weighty topics indeed that affect everyone
in Connecticut.

I continue working on issues to make Connecticut more affordable for
you. Things have been done to address the issue, but there is more that
needs to be done! I endeavor to work in a bipartisan way to get things
done. Topics of focus for me include expanding upon the leadership work
I did on prescription drug prices, income tax cuts, electricity bills,
child tax credits, public education funding, town aid, work force
development, public safety, and support for health care in northeast
Connecticut. I continue to defend our individual rights, parental
rights, and medical freedoms.

I'm proud to represent and work for you and Eastford. As always, please
reach out to me if I can help you with a constituent matter, answer a
question, or take up a concern. You can call my office at 860-240-8800,
e-mail me at <jeffrey.gordon@cga.ct.gov>, check for news and updates at
