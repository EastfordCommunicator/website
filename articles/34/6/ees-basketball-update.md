EASTFORD --- It's been an up-and-down season for the Eastford Bulldogs
boys' team, but at the halfway point, they find themselves in the hunt,
with a record of 2-2.

Starting out with a loss to St. James at home on Dec. 4, Eastford pulled
off two consecutive victories against Parish Hill (Dec. 8) and Wheeler
(Dec. 11), followed by a loss to Pomfret on Dec. 16. Originally
scheduled for Thursday, Dec. 18, Eastford's game against Ashford was
postponed, with a make-up date yet to be determined. The postponement
means that the Bulldogs head into the holiday break with a .500 record.
The victory against Parish Hill last month was the first for the program
in nearly three years, and Head Coach Zach Hutchings, who is in his
fourth year with the program, was excited to see if it would continue to
trend upward for the Bulldogs.

"I couldn't be prouder of the boys," Hutchings said after the game
on Dec. 8. "They showed hustle and grit that I hope to continue to see
throughout this season. I can't wait to go get some more."

It only took them three days to get their second win, as they handled
Wheeler at home on Dec. 11.

"The boys played with the same tenacity that got us a win the other
night," Hutchings said after the team's win over Wheeler. "Everyone
contributed. As a coach, you can't ask for much more."

Callum St. John has emerged as the offensive leader for the Bulldogs,
scoring 50 points through four games, an average of 12.5 points per
game. Charlie Ellsworth (6.8 ppg), Sylas Platt (6.3 ppg), Jackson Ritter
(4.8 ppg), Blake Gilbert (3.8 ppg), and Ryan Collard (2.3 ppg) have also
contributed points for the team.

After the holiday break, the Bulldogs boys' team will kick off the road
portion of their schedule with a visit to North Stonington, and a
rematch with Wheeler on Tuesday, Jan. 6. Tipoff (Varsity only) is slated
for 3:30 p.m.

## Bulldogs Girls' Team Searching For Elusive First Win

Shifting gears to the Bulldogs girls' team, the first all-girls team in
several years has been fighting for that first win, but it has not come
yet --- as the team stands 0-5 at the halfway point of the season with
losses to St. James (Dec. 4), Parish Hill (Dec. 8), Wheeler (Dec. 11),
Pomfret (Dec. 16), and Ashford (Dec. 18).

Mackenzie Lathrop is the team's leading scorer, with 21 points through
five games (4.2 ppg). Olivia DePercio (1.8 ppg), Zoë Labonte (1.2 ppg),
Emma-Lynn Salony (0.6 ppg), Georgia Barlow (0.4 ppg), and Aiyana Reed
(0.2 ppg) have also contributed offensively.

After the holidays, the Bulldogs girls' team will kick off the home
portion of their schedule by hosting Wheeler on Tuesday, Jan. 6. Junior
Varsity will tip off at 3:30 p.m., and Varsity tipoff is slated for 4:15
p.m.
