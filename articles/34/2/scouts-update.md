title: Scouts Stay Busy During Summer Season
---

EASTFORD/ASHFORD --- Scout Troop 92 has two candidates for advancement
to the rank of Eagle Scout. The candidates are John Zulick and Joe
Peppin. Both candidates have completed their Eagle Scout project, but
still have other requirements to fulfill. John used resources to build a
Gaga pit, a game structure, on the Ashford School grounds. Joe did a
complete rehabilitation of the Victorian era Gazebo next to the Ashford
Academy. We are proud that the results of these efforts yielded such
excellent results.

Eight Scouts from the Troop went to Summer Camp in August. It was hot
and the camp was at full capacity, more than 400 campers. Merit badges
at camp include Fishing, Engineering, Game Design, Plumbing, Automotive
Maintenance, Metal Work, Golf, Personal Fitness, Citizenship in the
Nation, Communication, Movie Making, Robotics, Space Exploration,
Swimming, Camping, Motor Boating, Leatherwork, Kayaking, Rifle Shooting,
Architecture, Radio, and Wilderness Survival. The campers were visited
by a Blackhawk helicopter that landed on the parade field for their
inspection.

The Troop sent Scout Henry Burnham to National Youth Leadership Training
in August. This is a weeklong training session.

Scout volunteers parked cars at the Brooklyn Fair. This was a fundraiser
for the Troop.

Upcoming: This fall, the Troop is planning a campout at Goodwin State
Forest in Hampton, near the Rail Trail. A bicycle ride is planned for a
day activity.

We welcome Doug Jenne as the new Cubmaster. This summer, Pack 92 raised
money to attend an overnight this winter. The cubs will vote on where to
go, but are hoping for the Mystic Aquarium, Science Center, or the CT
Air and Space Museum. Thank you to everyone who supported them at the
summer concert.

A few of our Cub Scouts attended Cub Country summer camp at the JNW
Scout camp in town. The theme for the summer was 'Cubstruction,'
focusing on city building and engineering themes. Here they learned
about teamwork and shaping the future through science and service. The
scouts also learned swimming, fishing, archery and lessons on rifle
safety with BB guns.

The first Cub Scout meeting will be Oct. 3, at 7 p.m., at Knowlton
Memorial Hall. Scout meetings are the second and last Tuesday of the
month and will meet at St Philip's Rec Center at 6:30 p.m. New members
are welcome.
