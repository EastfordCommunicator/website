title: Bowen Memorial Field Rededicated
---
EASTFORD --- On Saturday, July 26, Bowen Memorial Field was rededicated
in a special ceremony. Originally dedicated in 1974, the field has
recently undergone a significant revitalization thanks to the efforts of
the Bowen Field Committee, Pomfret Eastford Little League (PELL), and
the Town of Eastford.

We extend our sincere gratitude to the Bowen Field Committee members ---
Liz Scranton, Kate Moore, Ashlyn Ellsworth, Doug Woodward, Josh St.
Lawrence, and Brendan Walsh --- for their dedication and hard work.

We are also deeply thankful to the Bowen family for selling the land to
the Town of Eastford for just $1, and to our community for helping
preserve the dream of providing a vibrant and lasting space for
Eastford's youth to play and grow.

"Baseball teaches us what it means to work together, to rise after a
fall, and to keep swinging no matter how tough the pitch," said Bowen
Memorial Field Committee Chairman Liz Scranton. "The ballpark is more
than a place to play --- it is a gathering spot where friendships form,
families come together, and players learn lessons that last a lifetime.
When we choose to give back, whether through time, talent, or resources,
we are not just preserving the game --- we're investing in our
community's future."
