Sometimes, the little things make the biggest difference. "Shout Outs"
is your place to celebrate kindness, gratitude, and everyday heroes. Did
someone brighten your day? Help without asking? Go the extra mile when
no one was watching? Let's tell their story. Share your "shout out" and
together, we'll spread some joy --- one good deed at a time.

*Send your "shout outs" to Managing Editor Adam Minor at
<eastfordnews@gmail.com>, or send a message to us on our Facebook page.
Please keep your messages to 75 words or less. The editor has the right
to accept, reject, or edit any submission. Deadline to receive "shout
outs" is the 15^th^ of every month before the next publication.*
