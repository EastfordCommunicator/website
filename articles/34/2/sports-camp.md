EASTFORD --- The Congregational Church of Eastford, in partnership with
Living Proof Church of Ashford and UW Sports Ministry, held its annual
Sports Camp on the grounds of Eastford Elementary School, Monday to
Friday, July 21-25. The camp was held for children ages 4-12 and offered
flag football, soccer, basketball, cheerleading (girls only) for kids
ages 6-12, and skills development for 4- to 5-year-olds. Sports
instruction was led by college age athletes, and each day included a
Bible lesson and snack. Nearly 150 children registered for the event.
The theme was "Go the Distance," based on 2 Timothy 4:7-8. During the
week, the camp hosted a boys-versus-girls competition to see who could
raise the most money, which was collected to help communities and kids
who otherwise would not be able to afford sports camp. With a goal of
raising $1,300, the kids raised $1,360.79, which earned them the
opportunity to pie their leaders and pastors in the face.
