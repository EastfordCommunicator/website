title: Legislative Update
author: State Sen. Jeff Gordon

I continue working on issues to make Connecticut more affordable for
more people. Our state continues to rank poorly when it comes to
affordability. We all feel it every day when we buy groceries, fill our
cars up with gas, and pay electricity bills. Me too. There is more that
needs to be done. I endeavor to work in a bipartisan way to get things
done.

This legislative session, I worked on and voted for several major
efforts --- common sense, sustainable solutions that improve access to
affordable, high-quality child care and early childhood services. This
is not just about helping people now, but also about investing wisely in
families and the future of our state.

- Senate Bill 1 -- Increasing Resources for Students, Schools, and
Special Education
    - Creates and funds the Early Childhood Education Endowment Fund to
help stabilize and expand child care services, while limiting annual
costs for families;
    - Provides affordable health insurance options for child care providers
through Access Health CT.

- House Bill 5003 -- Concerning Early Childhood Care and Education
    - Improves transparency and ease of access to child care options for
families;
    - Modernizes and strengthens the Care 4 Kids payment system;
    - Expands licensing opportunities for larger in-home day cares.

- House Bill 7288 -- Bond Authorizations and Budget Implementation
    - Enables up to \$80 million in funding through the new Child Care
Facilities Grant Program, supporting construction and renovation of
licensed centers and homes.

This session, I was proud to be one of the bipartisan leaders working
alongside Speaker of the House Matt Ritter on a Child Tax Credit, a
meaningful way to support low- and middle-income families. I introduced
Senate Bill 112, to provide \$500 per child or other dependent claimed
on income tax forms. SB 112 got bipartisan support and was incorporated
into an overall legislative effort. In the toss and tumble of the
legislative session, a modified version was enacted for low-income
families who get an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). But this additional
tax credit was tagged as part of an increase in taxes, which is not a
good way to do it. I agree with Governor Lamont. While we work to help
families, we don't need more taxes, we need more taxpayers (including
more people and businesses coming to or staying in Connecticut).

However, my work continues. I am committed to expanding the credit to
include middle-income families, because hardworking parents deserve
meaningful relief and support in raising their children during these
ongoing, challenging economic times.
