It's apple season! Get outside, take in the fall foliage while you pick
apples with friends and family, and then bake your favorite desserts!

According to Connecticut Grown, apples are the "most commonly grown
fruit in Connecticut, with 280 farms tending orchards that cover more
than 2,000 acres." Common kinds of apples ready-to-pick in September are
Gala, Liberty, Macoun, Empire, Macintosh, Cortland, Ida Red, and Honey
Crisp. Looking on to October, you'll be able to pick Golden Delicious,
Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Mutsu, Fuji, Jonah-Gold, Pink Lady, and
Cameo.

Our very own Buell's Orchard (www.buellsorchard.com) has all kinds of
apples ready for picking. Support our local orchards in the Quiet
Corner. [For an easy-to-use guide to apple varieties in Connecticut, utilize CT Grown's guide here](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/doag/marketing_files/2015/applevarietiesctapples2015pdf.pdf).
