Despite the heat, there was lots of fun and laughter, friendships made
and new skills learned at camp this summer. We ran at close to full
capacity all summer with 800 children attending for over 1,450 camper
weeks.

As our summer program ends, we move on to concentrating on our Ragged
Hill Woods program offerings. We are excited to announce the appointment
of Alyssa Harvey as our new full-time Senior Program Coordinator. Alyssa
will be helping with curriculum development, teaching, social media and
recruitment. Alyssa worked with our Summer Camp Program for many years
before taking the last two summers off to pursue other educational and
career opportunities. We are thrilled that she will be bringing her
expertise, love of children and the outdoors to our programs.

To help with the expansion our Grants Committee is hard at work to raise
funds. The Chelsea Groton Foundation recently awarded Ragged Hill Woods
$3,500 to help with program expansion. Program expansion includes
increased staffing, supplies and providing fee support to help more
students attend programs. We are very grateful for this grant support.

Our fall series of Wednesday programs (4:30-5:30 p.m.) will be held on
Sept. 10, 17, 24, and Oct. 1, 15 and 22. [Check out our website for more details to sign
