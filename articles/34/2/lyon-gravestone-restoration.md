EASTFORD — Using a grant obtained from the State of Connecticut Neglected Cemetery Account Grant Program, the conservation and restoration to the General Nathaniel Lyon obelisk and four grave markers has been recently completed at General Lyon Cemetery on General Lyon Road. All work followed the standards for the treatment of historic properties. This monument is significant historically because it commemorates Eastford's most famous native son. Born in 1818, Lyon graduated from West Point, served with distinction in the Mexican War, and was the first Union general killed in the Civil War.
