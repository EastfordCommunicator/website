*Municipal election takes shape as candidates revealed*

EASTFORD --- Both the Democratic Town Committee (DTC) and the Republican
Town Committee (RTC) have announced their upcoming slates for the
upcoming Municipal Election on Tuesday, Nov. 4.

According to a press release sent to the *Communicator* last month, the
DTC held a caucus on July 15 at Midway Restaurant & Pizza in Ashford,
where they formally endorsed its slate of candidates, several of which
are cross-endorsed Republicans.

"In a continued spirit of community-focused governance, the Eastford
Democrats ... voted to cross-endorse several Republican candidates,
underscoring their commitment to non-partisan cooperation in local
government," the press release stated.

The endorsed Democratic candidates are:
- Ashlyn Ellsworth: Board of Selectmen, Full Term
- Michael Bilica: Board of Education, Full Term
- Nancy Neff: Board of Education, Full Term
- Robert Johnson: Board of Assessment Appeals, Full Term
- Randal Chinnock: Constable, Full Term
- Arvind Shaw: Constable, Full Term
- Meghan Martinez: Library Trustee, Full Term (Placeholder Appointment)

The DTC's cross-endorsed Republican candidates include:
- Deborah Richards: First Selectman, Full Term
- Johanna Wolfe: Town Clerk, Full Term
- Christine Hustus: Tax Collector, Full Term

"We're proud to put forward a slate of qualified, engaged, and
civic-minded individuals," said DTC Chairman Randal Chinnock, who was
elected Caucus Chairman for the July 15 meeting. "By endorsing both
Democrats and Republicans, we are choosing people --- not parties --- to
serve Eastford. Our priority is simple --- good governance and community
integrity."

"Our cross-endorsements reflect the Eastford way --- practical,
cooperative, and deeply local," said Caucus Secretary Jeannine Spink.
"These individuals have demonstrated a willingness to work across
differences for the good of the town."

The RTC also announced its slate of candidates in a press release to the
*Communicator*. The candidates include:
- Deborah Richards: First Selectman
- Paul Torcellini: Board of Selectman, Full Term
- Johanna Wolfe: Town Clerk
- Martha Burgess: Town Treasurer
- Christine Hustus: Tax Collector
- Lauren J. Barlow: Board of Education, Full Term
- Stephen Bowen: Board of Education, Full Term
- Armen Beermann: Library Board of Trustees, Full Term
- Seth Budd: Library Board of Trustees, Full Term
- Mary Degostin: Library Board of Trustees, Full Term
- Christopher Bowen: Constable, Full Term
- Nathaniel Fabian, Constable, Full Term

"This outstanding slate has a proven track record of accomplishments and
is ready to serve you for the ensuing two years. Vote Tuesday, Nov. 4,\"
said RTC Chairman Russ Mayhew.

"Despite the numerous challenges facing our community, the present
administration has made the necessary policy and operational
improvements without sacrificing town progress," added RTC member Rick
Torgeson. "They have also been able to craft budgets that reduced the
negative impact on our citizens, especially in the face of drastically
reduced state revenue. We are indeed fortunate to have the present
leadership in charge of Eastford. Let's keep our town on the right path
and re-elect the Republican candidates in November."

Lastly, on the Independent ticket, Mike Schultz also announced that he
will be running for First Selectman.

When asked for a comment on his campaign, and what he aimed to do if
elected as first selectman, Schultz said: "Stabilization."
