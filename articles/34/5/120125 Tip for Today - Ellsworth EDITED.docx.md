**Tips for Today**

One of the cool things about winter in the northeast is that we can
easily see the diverse types of year-round greenery. Most of our
evergreens are conifers, which means they have some form of a pinecone.
Some of these trees include eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), eastern
red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus),
balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and red spruce (Picea rubens). There are
other non-conifer evergreens, such as holly or boxwood.

You will often see the clubmoss princess pine (Dendrolycopodium
obscurum) or ground-shrub checkerberry (Gaultheria procumbens) growing
in the understory of woodlands. These two plants are evergreen ground
cover.

For ideas about how to include more evergreens around your yard or
community, you can find the 2025 Connecticut Native Perennial, Tree, &
Shrub Availability List compiled by the Connecticut Department of Energy
and Environmental Protection Bureau of Natural Resources Wildlife
Division and University of Connecticut College of Agriculture, Health,
