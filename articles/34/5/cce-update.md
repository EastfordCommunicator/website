Greetings and Merry Christmas, Eastford! What an abundance of blessings
we share in Eastford. We enjoy such beauty, the comfort and quiet of a
small town, and are surrounded by so many good and generous people.

Now, I grew up in the sunbelt, and so every year at this time I get all
excited about the prospect of a white Christmas. There have been more
than a few disappointments in recent years, but for me, hope springs
eternal. I have childhood images of snow and seeing your breath in the
cold air, of candles and Christmas lights, carols and tasty treats. I
think of sleigh bells and children all excited. New England Christmas is
special.

But, in the middle of my life I came to understand something much
better. When I was 39, a life crisis brought me to that humble place
where we find ourselves broken and out of solutions, and open to help.
My help came from above as I surrendered my life to Jesus. And it was
the best thing to ever happen to me.

So, for me, the most wonderful part of Christmas is the celebration that
Jesus, the Son of God, chose to abandon His lofty place in the
heavenlies and came to earth. He was born in a stinky stable because
there was no room in the inn that night. Angels proclaimed His birth to
simple shepherds. Jesus' crib was a feeding trough. Thirty-three years
later He humbled Himself and surrendered His all by dying on a cross for
us. His death paid for our sins, allowing us to be reconciled to the God
who created us and to be forgiven, set free from our captivities to the
bad stuff of this life, from guilt and from shame, and to even escape
death. Christmas is our celebration of this truth -- the Jesus really
and truly came. I do hope Jesus will be central to your Christmas. You
can worship with us if you like, or Eastford Baptist or any number of
solid churches in our area.

Two final thoughts. First, when Jesus' earthly parents, Mary and Joseph
needed a room that glorious night, there was no room in the inn. Our
lives are so full -- all busy with events and obligations, and so full
of distractions, sorrows and worries. I know I have a full plate. And
so, I plan to take my own advice in this -- to make Him room in my heart
and in my life this holiday season. I can tell you from experience that
if you make that move it will bring joy, peace, love and hope. And
second, on that glorious night when the sky filled with a great
multitude of angelic beings, they cried out, "Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace..." Jesus is the Prince of Peace. My prayer
and wish for you all is that His peace will be yours.

Merry Christmas!
