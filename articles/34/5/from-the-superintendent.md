On Nov. 10, I had a special opportunity to join the Eastford Elementary
School staff for a learning- and laughter-filled professional
development day at Mystic Seaport.

It is important to recognize that this professional development program,
provided by the Mystic staff, was supported by funds from the Beagary
Trust. Patricia Morgan, the director of the Beagary Trust, made a
long-time commitment to providing enriching experiential learning
experiences to students in rural school districts. As a result, our
students have had the opportunity to participate in several quality
learning experiences provided by the Mystic staff both at EES and at the
Mystic Seaport site.

December will be a busy month at Eastford Elementary School. Activities
include the Scholastic Book Fair, the school winter concert, and the
start of our boys and girls school basketball season. Please refer to
the monthly Principal Newsletters located in the For Families section of
our school website ([www.eastfordct.org]).

Service on the BOE is something to be recognized. As we welcome Nancy
Neff as the newest member of the Eastford Board of Education, Meg Scata,
the President of the Connecticut Boards of Education presented the
10-year pins of service to Stephen Bowen (12 years) and Robert Ellsworth
(13 years).

Why does budget time seem to come around much more quickly each year?
Although we are only five months into the current 2025-26 budget year,
the staff and administration are in the process of creating the
Superintendent's budget proposal that will be presented to the Board of
Education for its review and consideration at the Jan. 12 meeting. At
the November meeting, the BOE set the meeting dates for the Finance
Committee of the Board to develop the 2026-2027 education budget. Input
from all Eastford stakeholders is important to the BOE's successful
development of an informed budget that is responsive to the needs of the
students, staff, families, and community members. The BOE Finance
Committee, therefore, is inviting all Eastford citizens to its meeting
on Dec. 11 at 6 p.m. to provide insightful input to the budget
development process. Although not open to public comment, the public is
also invited and encouraged to attend the meetings of the BOE Finance
Committee that will be held on Jan. 22 and on Feb. 3 at 6 p.m. The BOE
anticipates approving the 2026-27 education budget for submission to the
town at its meeting on Feb. 12.

As we approach the end of 2025, I need to once again thank the staff,
families and community members who work together every day to support
the continued success of all Eastford students. All the best for a safe
December 2025 and a healthy beginning to the 2026 New Year. As always,
never hesitate to contact me at <dleake@eastfordct.org>. I hope to see you
at the December BOE meeting to share your thoughts regarding the 2026-27
school budget.
