EASTFORD --- On Wednesday, Nov. 12, Eastford Elementary School held a
ceremony in the front of the school to reveal the winner of the
PTO-sponsored school sign contest. According to the PTO, this year's
theme focused on growth mindset and learning from mistakes. Students
were encouraged to illustrate how they can overcome challenges with
practice and perseverance. Earlier in October, the entries were narrowed
down to four finalists. All students had the opportunity to vote for
their favorite sign out of these finalists. Pictured, the finalists
were, from left, fourth-grader Hope McGurl; fourth-grader Grace Moore;
second-grader Anna Moore; and seventh-grader Georgia Barlow. During the
ceremony on Nov. 12, it was revealed that Georgia Barlow had the winning
design. Her design will be featured on the sign for the next year.
