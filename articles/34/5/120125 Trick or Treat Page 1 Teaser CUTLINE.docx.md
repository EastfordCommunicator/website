EASTFORD --- The town featured a pair of Halloween trunk or treat events
this year, one at Buell's Orchard on Sunday, Oct. 26, and another hosted
by the Recreation Commission on Halloween night Friday, Oct. 31. Both
featured several creatively themed trunks for children to enjoy.
Pictured, Iris is all smiles as she poses for a photo in her pumpkin
outfit during the Buell's Orchard event. For more photos from this
year's Halloween festivities, turn to pages XX and XX!
