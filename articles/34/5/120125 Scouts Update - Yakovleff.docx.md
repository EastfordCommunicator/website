Camping trip, Veterans Day highlight Scouts schedule

ASHFORD --- Scouts recently went camping at Wolf Den Campground in
Pomfret. They learned how to make a primitive structure using knots and
lashings. Lunch was chicken stir fry.

On Veterans Day, Troop 92 provided an Honor Guard at Ashford School's
Veteran's Day Ceremony.

Scouts provided manpower to move books at the Babcock Library Book Sale.

At November and December Scout meetings, the Scout Law is being
discussed by Senior Scouts.

In November, the Cub Scouts worked on their citizenship adventure and
discussed what makes a person a good citizen. They also "Scouted for
Food" at the transfer station. A truck full of goods and over \$175 was
donated to the Ashford Food Bank.

In the month of December, the Cub Scouts will participate in their
annual Rain Gutter Regatta.

Upcoming events include an overnight at the New England Air Museum and
our annual Pinewood Derby.

Cub Scout meetings are the first Friday of the month at Knowlton
Memorial Hall at 6 p.m. New members are welcome.

Coming Up: Court of Honor and Christmas Party on Tuesday, Dec. 9. The
Court of Honor is for advancement in rank and awards.

Workcoeman and skiing at Ski Sundown Mountain.
