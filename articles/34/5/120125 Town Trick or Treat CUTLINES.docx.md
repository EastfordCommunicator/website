EASTFORD --- The Recreation Commission hosted its annual Trunk or Treat
event on Halloween night, Friday, Oct. 31, bringing dozens of children
to the Eastford Elementary School and Town Office Building parking lot
for an hour of family fun. Trunks ranged from aliens, to "Minions," to
Christmas, Harry Potter and beyond, as trunks offered a variety of
treats for children dressed up in their Halloween costumes.
