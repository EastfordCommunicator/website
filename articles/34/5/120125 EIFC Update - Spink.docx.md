A fun time was held for students and EIFC members at our annual visit to
Eastford Elementary School to celebrate Fire Prevention Week on Friday,
Oct. 17. A "mock" evacuation of the school was scheduled where all left
the building in a timely and orderly manner to congregate at the rear of
the school. Once the fire department located the alarm and disengaged
it, the lower grades were escorted to the gym for a program. Members
showed the typical turn-out gear that is worn, while members were
"crawling" on the floor allowing the students to "touch."

Today's students are well versed on "stop, drop, and roll," how to call
"911," and to help their parents designate a safe place to congregate in
case of a fire emergency. Eastford parents can be assured that your
children are well educated and know what to do.

Following the gym presentation, students were escorted outside to view
the compartments and climb in and out of the cabs of the engine tanker
where the firemen sit. Goodie bags were given to the children at the end
of the school day. See the photos attached to this article!

The EIFC responded to 21 "911" emergency calls in October. Drills were
extrication, moving patients, chimney fires and ladders.

Happy Halloween! On Sunday, Oct. 26, the company participated in Trunk
or Treat at Buell's Orchard, and on Oct. 31, we gave out more candy at
the EES Trunk or Treat, including a truck for viewing.

When we reset our clocks for fall, smoke alarms and changing the
batteries play a key part of a home fire escape plan.

Install smoke alarms inside and outside each sleeping area, on every
level of the home including the attic and basement. Test all alarms at
least once a month. A smoke alarm should be on the ceiling or high on a
wall, and at least 10 feet from the stove to reduce false alarms when
cooking. People who are hard-of-hearing or deaf can install special
alarms that have strobe lights. Replace all smoke alarms when they are
10 years old. Develop a family escape plan with two ways out and a
meeting place -- and practice your plan!

In your safety plan, consider the use of carbon monoxide detectors.
Carbon monoxide is invisible. The colorless, odorless and tasteless gas
is a byproduct of burning organic fuels. Sources are household
appliances and equipment fueled with gas, oils, coal, kerosene or wood.
Examples are furnaces, water heaters, space heaters, cars, charcoal
grills, clothes dryers, ovens, fireplaces, lawn mowers, and snowblowers.
Early symptoms often mimic the flu -- headache, nausea, unclear
thinking, shortness of breath, weakness and loss of muscle control.
Severe symptoms are convulsions, unconsciousness and possible death. To
help prevent poisoning, clean and inspect fuel-burning appliances, check
for proper ventilation. If you suspect carbon monoxide poisoning leave
your home immediately, do not open windows and doors, call 911 and the
EIFC will respond to test carbon monoxide levels.

Guess who is coming to breakfast? Santa! On Saturday, Dec. 20, from 9-11
