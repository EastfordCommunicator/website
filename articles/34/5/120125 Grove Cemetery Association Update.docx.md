**From the Grove Cemetery Association Board of Trustees**

Do you own a family cemetery plot?

Rather than putting off decisions regarding the layout of your plot
until a time of urgent need, many families find that it is beneficial to
get "pre-need\" input from those intending to be buried in Grove
Cemetery as to where each person will rest in the family plot. Getting
input from family members now regarding who intends to use the family
plot, whether they prefer cremation or a full burial, and where they
prefer to be located, can avoid problems which may arise when family
members pass and are buried without any consideration regarding an
overall plan for the site.

The Grove Cemetery Association is eager to discuss with you (at no cost)
the best way to lay out your plot to satisfy all planned users. With
your input we will create a plot-use diagram for both you and the
cemetery to file for future reference. Feel free to call us for more
information at (860) 428-0280.
