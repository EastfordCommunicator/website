EASTFORD --- Coming off a tough 2024-25 basketball campaign, the
Eastford Bulldogs are looking to reset this season (which begins on
Thursday, Dec. 4) with a few key changes in store.

Over the last few years, due to participation, EES has put together a
co-ed team, with both boys and girls competing on the same squad. This
year, however, interest has peaked to the point where both boys and
girls will now be able to compete on their own teams. Zach Hutchings is
set to return as head coach of the boys' team, while Jennifer Barlow
will take over head coaching duties for the girls' squad, which hasn't
fielded a team of its own since before the COVID-19 pandemic.

"I'm super excited to bring back a girls basketball team for the first
time since before COVID," Barlow said. "I will likely be growing and
learning just as much, if not more than these girls, but it should be a
fun year."

Hutchings said he is looking forward to returning to the sidelines to
lead the Bulldogs boys' team.

"I am excited to play in a new, more competitive division this season,"
he said. "We have one of the best eighth graders in northeast
Connecticut and we have some underclassmen that are going to make some
solid contributions."

After coaching both boys and girls over the past few seasons, Hutchings
added that he is excited to see where Barlow takes the girls' team this
year.

"I'm ecstatic that we have the numbers for a girls team this year," he
said. "I know from last year that there are some girls with amazing
potential that I hope get a chance to really experience the game this
season. With Coach Barlow's positive attitude and approach, I'm
confident they will find success. Let's go Bulldogs!"

Eastford, which participates in the Quinebaug Valley Junior Conference
(QVJC), is set to compete in 10 contests during the regular season,
featuring both a home game and an away game against fellow QVJC teams
St. James (Danielson), Parish Hill (Chaplin), Wheeler (North
Stonington), Pomfret, and Ashford. Pomfret is the defending QVJC
champion, having defeated Canterbury in last year's finals. The
*Communicator* will report game results as they happen, including photos
when able, live on the *Communicator* Facebook page, so stay tuned for
ongoing coverage this basketball season!
