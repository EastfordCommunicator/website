Did you know that at one time, the Eastford Congregational Church bell
was rung when there was a death in the village? The bell tolled in
strokes of 10, stopped for a few seconds, then began again until it
tolled the person's age. Then, after another pause, it tolled one stroke
of the bell for the death of a man or two strokes for a woman. The
relatives of the deceased paid 25 cents for this service.

This piece of Eastford history was taken from an article entitled "Old
Eastford" by Warren P. Keith, originally published in the *Putnam
Patriot* in 1947.
