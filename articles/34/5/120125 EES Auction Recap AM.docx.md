EASTFORD --- It takes years of fundraising to supply the funds needed to
bring an entire grade of Eastford Elementary School students on a
multiday field trip to Washington D.C. every spring. Thankfully, the
annual Goods & Services Auction plays a major part in meeting that need.

The latest iteration of the fundraiser, hosted by the EES Auction
Committee, was held Saturday, Nov. 15, and raised more than \$15,000 for
the field trip, which is slated for May 19-22, 2026, and this year will
include 29 students in both grades 7 and 8. The full night included a
live auction, a silent auction with dozens of items, and a raffle for
gift cards and other items from businesses from throughout eastern
Connecticut and beyond. A bake sale and pizza from Pizza 101 in Pomfret
also added opportunities for people to support the event.
