Here's a two-for-one opportunity! Benefit your financial well-being and
your community through one philanthropic gift. As you engage in your
year-end tax planning, particularly the impact of recent tax law
changes, please consider a gift to *The Eastford Communicator*. The
*Communicator* is a 501(c)(3) organization and any gift made to it is
tax-deductible under IRS rules.

And it's easy to do! Simply send your donation to *The Eastford
Communicator,* P.O. Box 253, Eastford, CT 06242.

During this holiday season, a time of thanksgiving and reflection --- on
our lives and the lives of others --- we of the *Communicator* are
especially grateful for the support of the community and the individuals
who enable us each month to fulfill our mission of informing the people
of Eastford and thereby strengthening our sense of community so that it
is more robust, more cohesive, and more enduring.
