MANSFIELD --- To commemorate Veterans Day, area veterans were honored at
a special ceremony at E.O. Smith High School in Mansfield on Saturday,
Nov. 8, and the message was clear --- veterans will not be forgotten.

The event, which was attended by more than 150 people in the E.O. Smith
auditorium, honored veterans from Mansfield, Ashford, Eastford, Union
and Willington. In particular, Vietnam veterans were highlighted at the
event. Speakers included State Sen. Jeff Gordon and State Sen. Mae
Flexer, as well as Ted Graziani, a U.S. Army Vietnam veteran from 1966
to 1968, and a former Democratic member of the Connecticut House of
Representatives, representing District 57 from 1999 to 2011. Other
speakers included Mansfield Mayor Toni Moran, American Legion Post 52
Chaplain Len Theroux, Mansfield Town Council member Dr. Carlita Cotton,
and VFW Post 938 Commander Edward D'Agata. Boy Scout Troops 56
(Mansfield) and 156 (South Glastonbury) led the Pledge of Allegiance and
the Posting of the Colors inside the auditorium. A separate posting of
the colors, as well as a Placing of the Wreath, was live streamed from
the Veterans Memorial outside of Mansfield Town Hall.

Gordon, who represents Eastford as part of the state's 35^th^ Senate
District, offered his thanks for the service of our local veterans.

"One of the things that I learned growing up, not just in school, but
from family members who served in the Armed Forces, is to meet with
veterans, meet with their families," Gordon said. "Don't just learn what
veterans did in history books. ... The more we can learn from you ---
what you've done, each one of your stories, and what your families went
through --- the better we can be as elected officials, and also as
citizens, to say thank you ... and also what more we can do to be of
help to you."

Focusing specifically on Vietnam veterans, Gordon acknowledged that
Vietnam veterans not only faced struggles abroad, but have also faced
them in the years since returning home.

"When we talk about those who served during the Vietnam War, not only
did you serve in the battles there in Vietnam and abroad, but then you
had to face different battles --- very difficult ones --- when you came
home, with the way that you and many of your family members were treated
by this country. You didn't get the thank you and the recognition you
deserve," he said. "Veterans Day is not just one day for us to recognize
you and all your fellow veterans, but it's every day of the year, and
we should be very mindful of that. ... You serve your country with duty,
commitment, faith, defending our way of life, our security, our peace,
our freedoms and liberties. But your service never ended, and for you it
hasn't ended at all. You're continuing to serve in all sorts of ways.
I'm amazed by the degrees and the scope of service over the years that
you do. ... We know that no matter how many 'thank yous' we say, no
matter the work we do, we can never make up truly for the sacrifice you
and your families went through. But still, we try and we hope to do
better in that regard."

For Graziani, his passionate speech focused on the honor displayed by
Vietnam veterans in the face of many trials upon their return from a war
that was rife was controversy.

"We did our jobs," he said. "We didn't ask for anything when we came
back but a little respect. Perhaps we were naive thinking that when we
came home we would have a parade in our honor. But that didn't happen.
... The tragic thing about Vietnam is that half the country supported
us, and half did not. They blamed the warrior and not the politicians.
We did as we were told. We took an oath. We didn't say, 'Well, we
really don't feel like going.' You went. You went and you served with
distinction."

Graziani went on to urge those in attendance to continue supporting
veterans, because it still remains one of the most important things we
can do for them.

"I am so proud to see people wearing Vietnam era hats," he said. "Back
then, even if you were a veteran, you didn't want it to be known that
you were in Vietnam. But time heals everything. And we look at that as
support. And basically, that's what we all need in our daily lives ---
support."
