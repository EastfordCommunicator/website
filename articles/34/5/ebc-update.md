As December arrives and our little town begins to glow with Christmas
lights on porches and wreaths on doors, I am always reminded why this
season stirs something deep within us.

Christmas has a way of slowing us down and calling us to pause, breathe,
and remember the story that changed the world. In a season filled with
busyness, shopping lists, and travel plans, the heart of Christmas is
still as simple and beautiful as ever: "For unto you is born this day
... a Savior, who is Christ the Lord" (Luke 2:11). That announcement,
delivered first to ordinary people going about an ordinary day, reminds
us that God steps into the lives of regular people like us. He meets us
in our joy and sorrow, our hopes and fears, our questions and burdens.
The good news of Christmas is that Jesus Christ, God has come near to
bring "good tidings of great joy" (Luke 2:10) to all who would believe.

So, throughout the month of December, we will be celebrating that good
news each week through the season of Advent. During all four Sundays, we
will focus our hearts on Christ and why His coming is such good news,
and how God invites us to lift our eyes and hearts again to His promises
and the faithfulness He has shown in the birth of His Son. If you do not
have a church home, or if it has been a long time since you have
worshiped anywhere, I want to extend a heartfelt invitation to you and
your family. We would love to welcome you this December at Eastford
Baptist Church (133 Union Rd.). Come as you are, whether you are full of
faith or full of questions.

And of course, one of the most cherished moments of our year is our
Christmas Eve Candlelight Service at 4 p.m. It is a beautiful, quiet
evening where we gather to sing the Christmas carols we love, hear the
Scriptures that tell the story of Christ's birth, and watch as our old
sanctuary glows with candlelight, one small flame at a time, reminding
us that "the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not
overcome it" (John 1:15). My family and I would be honored to share that
evening with you. From our home to yours, we wish you a merry and
meaningful Christmas. May the peace of Christ rest upon you and your
household this season.
