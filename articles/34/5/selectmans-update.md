Congratulations to all candidates elected in the election! Together, we
will make a positive difference for our town.

Work has been completed on the Trout Dam, shimming has been completed on
Parts of Ashford Road and Old Colony, and major repairs have been
completed on Public Works Truck #1.

Congratulations to Public Works employee James Roy, who completed the
Connecticut Road Masters Program. James joins Ben Schmidt, who received
his certification a few years ago. Eastford is lucky to have two
talented and dedicated Road Masters serving our community.

Thank you to the Registrars, moderator, poll workers, Town Clerk and all
others who worked long hours in the last election.

I recently had the honor of attending a multi-town Veterans Recognition
Ceremony at E.O. Smith High School on Saturday, Nov. 8, where local
leaders, state senators, and state representatives came together to
recognize and thank our Vietnam veterans for their service and
sacrifice.

Eastford is proud to honor the following veterans: Charles Belden, John
Bergeron, William Bradley, Arthur Brodeur, Scott Bunnell, Robert Drake,
Alfred Green, Gary Green, Melvin Green, Walter Gribauskas, Guy Grube,
Theodore Manthorne, Harry Marshall, John Matywko, Russell Mayhew,
Douglas Milanese, Glenn Orcutt, David Olsen, Carlton Reed III, George
Rukstela, Arthur Slocum, Daniel Smithwick III, David Forbes Thornhill,
Richard Torgeson, Melodye Whatkey, and Robert Whatley. Thank you all for
your service and dedication to our country.
