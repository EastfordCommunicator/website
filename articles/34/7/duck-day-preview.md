title: Spring or Winter Ahead? Scramble set for Annual Prediction

*Scramble the Duck is scheduled to make his annual seasonal prediction at
the Ivy Glenn Memorial on Monday, Feb. 2, at 7:30 a.m.*


EASTFORD --- Scramble the Duck is once again ready to make his annual
prediction!

Scramble holds a perfect accuracy record compared to all groundhogs, and
will predict either an early spring or an extended winter on Monday,
Feb. 2, at 7:30 a.m. at the Ivy Glenn.

The event, which is known as "Duck Day," has become a town tradition
over the past decade. If Scramble sees his shadow, he will forecast
another six weeks of winter. If he does not, he will predict an early
spring. A scroll will be read by Scramble's handlers to announce the
result.

Scramble maintains a close eye on the weather and performs cutting edge
research at Stormy Heights Academy. Scramble promises that this year's
prediction will be accurate, and will choose one of two scrolls, which
will declare his prediction.

For those not able to attend in person, the event will also be live
streamed at [scrambletheduck.org/livestream](https://scrambletheduck.org/livestream).
