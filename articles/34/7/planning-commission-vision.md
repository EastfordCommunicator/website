title: Planning Commission seeks POCD input from residents
---

EASTFORD --- Do you have comments about development in Eastford? Are you
interested in providing input on the vision for Eastford's future?

The Town of Eastford Planning Commission has begun the process of
updating the town's Plan of Conservation & Development (POCD). The POCD
sets the vision for how the town would like to move forward over the
next 10 years. The Planning Commission is responsible for updating the
POCD at a minimum of once every 10 years, as required by state statutes.
Eastford's POCD was last updated in 2016 and can be found on the
town's website. This update provides an opportunity for the town to
consider whether to make changes in the goals and objectives for the
community.

Your input helps shape the plan. The deadline to complete the survey is
Feb. 28. [You can find it on the town website here](https://www.eastfordct.gov/land-use-office/page/planning-commission-forms-documents).
You can also pick up paper copies at the Town Office Building, Library,
or the Post Office. The Planning Commission looks forward to your input.
