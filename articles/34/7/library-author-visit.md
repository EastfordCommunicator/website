title: Library Welcomes Rhode Island Author for Discussion Event
---

EASTFORD --- On Saturday, Jan. 17, the Eastford Public Library welcomed
Rhode Island author Christa Carmen for a conversation between her and
Jody Blanchette. Carmen is the author of *The Daughters of Block
Island*, winner of the Bram Stoker Award and a Shirley Jackson Award
finalist, the Indie Horror Book Award-winning *Something Borrowed,
Something Blood-Soaked*, and the Bram Stoker Award-nominated "Through
the Looking Glass and Straight into Hell" (*Orphans of Bliss: Tales of
Addiction Horror*). At the event, Carmen shared about her life, writing
journey, creative process, and what inspires her. A reception designed
around her newest book, *How to Fake a Haunting,* followed the
discussion. Lincoln Budd lent a deer skull and animal skins to set the
scene! Dan Belanger created all the signs for this event.
