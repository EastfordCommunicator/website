Every February, our culture observes Valentine's Day, a day set apart to
celebrate love. However, if you take a look at how our culture
celebrates this holiday, it highlights a certain kind of love --- the
fiery red, heart-shaped, romantic kind of love --- the kind of love we
see depicted in soap operas and rom-coms, where lovers go to extreme
ends to show their devotion. This is the kind of love Valentine's Day
highlights.

This sort of love feels good. I have experienced the thrill of this
explosive love towards another, and I'd be willing to bet you have as
well. I am by no means trying to knock romance, as I probably wouldn't
be married without it. It is where most romantic relationships begin!

Nevertheless, long-lasting relationships do not remain in this explosive
phase of love, despite what today's romance novels and films might
suggest. In a lot of ways, our culture's picture of love is restricted
to and synonymous with this romantic love, placing unrealistic
expectations on our relationships to always be explosive and exciting.
And when they're not, we move on, in search of the next jolt of romance.

I think many of us can agree our culture isn't painting an honest
picture of what real love truly looks like. Deep down, we know real love
is more than this.

As a pastor, I have had the wonderful privilege of officiating a handful
of weddings. Leading up to the ceremonies, I meet with each couple to
decide details, logistics, and to go over their vows. Standard wedding
vows include promises to love and cherish each other "for better or for
worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death
do us part." We've all heard these before.

The truth is, life isn't always romantic. We get sick unexpectedly. We
hit hard times. Wedding vows recognize this reality. Romantic love isn't
what you need when life goes sideways. A different kind of love is
required. A steadier, quieter kind of love.

Perhaps you're rolling into this new year a little worse for wear.
You're tired and hurting. Maybe the explosive nature of a romantic
relationship has blown up your life. I'd like to offer you something
better than a heart-shaped sugar rock. I'd like to invite you to
consider where I've found a bottomless source of real and steady love.

There is a famous passage in the Bible quoted very often at weddings
that speaks of this real love. It defines love in a myriad of ways, but
one aspect it reiterates is how love endures. "Love bears all things,
believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never
ends." Where does this love come from, and how can you experience it?

Well, I'll be straight forward. This love is found in Jesus.

Depending on who you are, dear reader, this may cause you to either roll
your eyes, laugh, or nod in agreement. When I first heard it stated that
a man who lived 2,000 years ago had something to offer me, it left me
more confused than anything else, until I experienced it myself. Jesus
isn't as explosive or alluring as what our culture is trying to sell
you, but I've found His to be the most genuine, steady, and compelling.

If you'd like to learn more, I'd invite you to either come visit our
church (10 a.m. every Sunday at the Eastford Elementary School), or
reach out to me (<evan.cceastford@gmail.com>). And happy Valentine's Day!
May our town be a place where the explosion of romantic love stirs up
more of the real, quiet love we all need.
