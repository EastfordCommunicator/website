SUB HEAD: Despite winless season, team 'demonstrated tremendous growth'

EASTFORD --- If the 2025-26 Eastford Bulldogs season could be summed up
in two words, they would probably be, "fresh start."

Despite a winless record (0-10) for this year's girls' team, it was a
time of growth for a team that hadn't existed for six years.

"The girls demonstrated tremendous growth as a team throughout the
season," Barlow said. "Many of the teams we faced commented on their
grit and exemplary sportsmanship."

Eastford faced off in two games apiece against Parish Hill, Wheeler,
Pomfret, Ashford, and St. James, losing all 10 games. Despite the
results, Barlow noted that this team was essentially starting from
scratch in a league that featured teams with players with tons more
experience playing together.

"It is important to note that this was our first girls' team since
2020," she said. "In contrast, many opposing schools have groups of
players who have competed together for years and already established
strong camaraderie --- something our team is just beginning to build.
Several of our players were new to basketball, making their progress all
the more impressive."

One advantage the Bulldogs can take from this season is the fact that
this squad featured no graduating eighth graders, which means each
player (if they choose to do so) will be eligible to return for another
run next year.

Seventh graders Mackenzie Lathrop (34) and Olivia DePercio (31) emerged
as the team's scoring leaders this season, something Barlow hopes will
bring momentum into next season as the girls continue to develop their
skills.

"Looking ahead, we are in a strong position. We have no eighth graders,
so while we may welcome new fifth graders next year, the core of the
team will return with valuable experience, a deeper understanding of the
game, and a stronger sense of teamwork."

As the Bulldogs close the book on this season, Barlow expressed her
gratitude for her players.

"Although basketball is not my primary sport, it has been a genuine
pleasure to get to know these athletes, learn the game alongside them,
and watch their confidence and skills grow," she said. "Great job,
Bulldog ladies."
