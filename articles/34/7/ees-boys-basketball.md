*Hutchings touts 'heart and effort' as program looks to future*

EASTFORD --- The Eastford Bulldogs boys' basketball season was a story
of ups and downs.

Getting off to a fast 2-1 start with key wins against Wheeler and Parish
Hill in December, it looked as though the Bulldogs were on a clear path
to the playoffs. However, Eastford would not see another victory, as
they finished the season on a seven-game losing streak at 2-8, missing
the playoffs.

Despite the finish, there was much to celebrate this year, as the
Bulldogs won their first game in three years in December, a good start
to what will hopefully be a bright future for the program, according to
Head Coach Zach Hutchings.

"The boys came together this year for the best season we have had since
2020," Hutchings said. "What we lacked in talent, we made up for in
heart and effort. We have a great group of fifth, sixth, and seventh
graders that I'm excited to see come back next year."

Hutchings added he was excited to see the upcoming talent on the junior
varsity (JV) squad, and looked forward to developing their skills.

"The JV squad was young and new to basketball, but they showed heart and
hustle that guarantees their success as they learn the game," he said.

The Bulldogs' leading scorer this year was eighth grader Callum St.
John, who emerged as a leader last year, and continued his development
this season, scoring at least 123 total points this season (not counting
points scored against Wheeler on Jan. 6, a game for which we could not
verify statistics), accounting for a scoring rate of 13.6 points per
game.

"Callum is the best player I have had the pleasure of coaching, and is
one of --- if not the --- best player in eighth grade in our entire
league this year," Hutchings said. "While his basketball skills are
impressive, his growth as a leader on and off the court is what shined
to me."

Blake Gilbert (35 points) and Ryan Collard (15 points) are also eighth
graders who have played their last games in an Eastford uniform.
Hutchings praised Gilbert as his pick for "most improved player."

"Blake was the most improved player this year and his defensive
contributions, and sharp shooting, were imperative to the wins we got
this season," he said, adding that Collard, as well as eighth grader
Aiden Abbamonte were "amazing additions" to the team as well.

"[Collard and Abbamonte] showed tremendous effort and contagious,
positive attitudes," Hutchings said. "The whole team wishes they had
played more than one year."

Seventh graders Charlie Ellsworth (78 points), Sylas Platt (69 points),
and Jackson Ritter (33 points) also made significant contributions to
the Bulldogs' scoring attack, which will be needed as they emerge as the
team's leaders in the 2026-27 season.

With Callum St. John's departure from the team also means the departure
of Callum's father, Chris, as the team's assistant coach, who has been
with the team for the past three years.

"Chris' contributions to the kids' basketball fundamentals have been a
huge part of any successes we have achieved over his time with us,"
Hutchings said. "Chris has donated his time and knowledge in a kind and
positive way that I have seen several kids benefit from, both on and off
the court. His insight has helped me grow as a coach and as a person. He
will be missed. Thank you, Chris."
