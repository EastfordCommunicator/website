title: What's New with Scout Troop 92?*
---
ASHFORD/EASTFORD --- In early January, Scouts in Troop 92 enjoyed a ski
trip to Mt. Ski Sundown. This was a daytrip. There were no injuries.

The Troop was gearing up for the Klondike Derby that took place the end
of January. The Klondike Derby is a regional event with widespread
participation. Participants compete outdoors in different events. Scouts
stay outdoors during the entire Derby and campout in tents. Ideal
weather for the Derby is below freezing temperatures, snow, sunny and
low wind. This time of year, you never know what you are going to get.
After the Derby is over and you enter a heated building, it feels
"funny."

We will have a report and photos in the March *Communicator*.

Troop 92 Scout meetings are the second and fourth Tuesdays of the month
at 6:30 p.m. at St. Philip's Rec Center. New members are welcome.

Cub Scout Report: In January, the Cubs worked on their swimming
adventure and spent time swimming at Mansfield Community Center's pool.
This month the scouts will attend an overnight at the New England Air
Museum. In addition, the pack meeting this month will include a workshop
on how to build Pinewood Derby cars in preparation for the big race in
March.

Cub Scouts try to raise funds to offset the cost of Scouting adventures
and over nights. Please keep an eye out for our meat stick fundraiser at
the winter farmer's market.

We are also selling Munson's Chocolate during the end of February.
Anyone interested in purchasing can contact the Cub Scouts at
ctcubscoutspack92@gmail.com.

Cub Scout meetings are held the first Friday of the month at 6 p.m. at
Knowlton Hall. New Cubs are always welcome.

Celebrate Valentine's Day, Feb. 14. Don't forget!
