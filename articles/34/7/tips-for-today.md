Happy Winter!

Have you considered sowing some seeds now for your spring garden? Easily
grow some of your favorite veggies or fruits in a milk jug, or
paper-based juice carton and have seedlings ready-to-go in the spring.

You can purchase small, biodegradable pots if you prefer. Grab some
seeds and potting soil and get started. Once planted, be sure to place
your seeds as close to sunlit windows as possible. Alternatively, there
are sunlamps that use artificial light to help cultivate plants indoors.

Some seeds that are good to start now include cauliflower, broccoli,
leeks, cabbage, and onions. Bonus points for selecting plants that
support our pollinators. For tips on sowing seeds out-of-doors, [go to
the Maine-based Wild Seed Project's blog](https://wildseedproject.net/blog/ideal-time-for-sowing-native-seeds).
