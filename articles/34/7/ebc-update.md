February often feels like the heart of winter with busy schedules, long
weeks, and the weight of everyday concerns can quietly wear us down. In
seasons like this, having a place to gather, reflect, and be encouraged
matters.

Each Sunday at Eastford Baptist Church, we gather together because we
need truth, hope, community and encouragement. Our Sunday School for all
ages meets at 9:15 a.m., followed by our 10:30 a.m. worship service.
These times are designed for families, individuals, and anyone looking
for a meaningful start to their week.

During our worship service, we are currently working verse-by-verse
through the biblical book of 1 John, a letter written to help people
find clarity, assurance, and confidence in what they believe. Its
message speaks directly to real life, real questions, and real
struggles, reminding us of the hope found in Christ and the importance
of walking together in faith.

In addition to Sundays, we offer several mid-week opportunities for
connection and growth. Our "Olympians" kids' ministry (grades 1--6) and
Teen Club (grades 7--12) provide a fun, safe, and Christ-centered
environment where young people can build friendships and learn biblical
truth. We also offer a discipleship class for adults that is currently
exploring the history of the Bible --- how it was written, preserved,
and passed down to us. In addition, a women's Bible study meets
regularly for encouragement, prayer, and study together.

Whether you are looking for a church home, a place for your children or
teens, or simply a community where you can grow and ask meaningful
questions, you are welcome. Our doors are open, and we would be glad to
see you this February.
