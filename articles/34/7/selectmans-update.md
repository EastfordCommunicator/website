January has brought several infrastructure challenges requiring prompt
attention and repair. At the Ivy Glenn, the 30-year-old boiler failed
its CT State inspection and has since been replaced. A chimney
inspection will be conducted next to determine whether any additional
work is needed to meet required standards.

At the Town Office Building, the furnace heat exchanger failed. Although
the unit is still covered under a five-year warranty and the replacement
cost is included, the inspection identified additional issues not
covered by the warranty. These repairs were expected to be completed by
mid-January, as of this writing.

We received a strong response to the open snowplow driver and Transfer
Station attendant positions. Interviews are currently underway, and
offer letters will be issued shortly.

The Town of Eastford Planning Commission has also begun the process of
updating the town's Plan of Conservation and Development (POCD), which
outlines the community's vision for the next ten years. Resident surveys
are available at the Town Office Building, Post Office, and Library, or
online via the QR code on the Town's website.

Interest continues to grow in expanding the Senior Committee by
connecting residents with shared interests. Several individuals have
expressed enthusiasm for activities such as a walking or hiking club,
social gatherings like group lunches, and creative groups for knitting
or crocheting. Veterans have also shown interest in meeting for coffee
and conversation. In addition, there may be residents willing to
volunteer for a "Fix It" Workshop --- held up to three times a year ---
where seniors can bring small appliances to the lower level of the Town
Office Building for repair by volunteer helpers.

All of these initiatives can be organized under the Senior Committee.
Residents interested in joining or chairing the committee, leading a
group, proposing new activities, or participating in any of these
opportunities are encouraged to contact selectmen@townofeastford.com.
Volunteers are essential to making this effort successful --- come be
part of a growing and exciting new community group!
