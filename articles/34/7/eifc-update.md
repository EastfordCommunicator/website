Neighbors Helping Neighbors: Happy New Year from the EIFC. The year 2025
was a very busy year for the company, responding to 264 "911"
emergencies, the highest number recorded in minutes.

The EIFC is steeped in history. We have been in existence since December
1917, a fire department becoming a reality in 1938, incorporated in 1942
with 28 charter members, and the first inhouse meeting on May 1, 1951,
in its current location.

We rounded out the year with our annual Christmas Party for members and
their families with good food, decorations and fun on Dec. 17, and a
visit from Santa and his Elf at a pancake breakfast on Dec. 20. Thank
you to the town's people who attended the breakfast and left generous
donations.

We responded to 28 "911" emergencies in December. A detailed report (by
district and incidents) is provided below showing our 2025 mutual aid
town assignments.

What is mutual aid? Mutual aid is assistance between fire departments
requesting help from other agencies on an incident-by-incident basis.
This system allows for the movement of backup resources throughout the
covered areas, across town boundaries to maintain coverage or respond to
multiple alarms.

We, a 100-percent volunteer organization, rely on the generous annual
monetary support we get from you, our town residents. Finances are tight
due to the escalation of costs to maintain the company's function to
meet training and equipment requirements. Through your generosity, you
are helping us make a difference in your community and assist us in
upholding a feeling of personal satisfaction that we get from helping
our mutual aid friends and neighbors 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Donations can be mailed to EIFC, P.O. Box 333, Eastford, CT 06242. Your
donation is crucial in supporting Station "71" and its future.

Thank you to the Eastford Communicator Committee for giving us the
opportunity to use the *Communicator* as a vehicle to inform the town of
what we accomplish and offer daily.
