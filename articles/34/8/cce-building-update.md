title: Building Hope in Eastford: A Season of Visible Progress

EASTFORD --- When I first arrived in Eastford, I was struck by the quiet
beauty of this small town and the strength of its people. Today,
standing on John Perry Road and looking at the new church building, that
first impression has only grown stronger. What began as lines on paper
and stakes in the ground has now become a structure you can walk
through, touch, and imagine filled with life.

The new church is now 100-percent framed, and the shape of the sanctuary
and ministry spaces is fully visible. You can stand where the
congregation will one day worship, look up, and see the roof overhead,
no longer simply a concept, but a reality. The building is dried in, the
shell is protecting the work inside, and we have turned an important
corner from heavy structural construction to the detailed finishes that
will make this space feel like home.

Windows have been installed, bringing natural light into the sanctuary,
classrooms, and fellowship spaces. As you walk through the building, you
can now see how the sun will move across the room during a Sunday
service or an evening gathering. Even in its unfinished state, the play
of light through these windows hints at the warmth and welcome this
church will offer to the community.

Inside the building, systems that you may never see but will rely on
every week are coming together. Furnaces are being installed so that the
church will be comfortable in every season. Mechanical, electrical, and
plumbing trades are coordinating their work so that when the
congregation returns, everything behind the walls and above the ceilings
will perform the way it should. These are critical steps on the path to
completion, and the teams on site are working diligently to keep the
project advancing.

Drywall installation has begun on both the walls and ceilings, and this
phase is transforming the interior spaces day by day. Rooms that once
felt like open framing now have defined boundaries and more finished
proportions. You can begin to picture classrooms filled with children,
hallways lined with familiar faces on Sunday mornings, and a sanctuary
ready to hold worship, prayer, and song. Each new sheet of drywall
brings the church one step closer to that reality.

We are anticipating a mid-summer completion, and that target feels more
tangible with every passing week. There is still much to do, from
finishes and trim to flooring, painting, and final inspections, but the
project is on a clear and encouraging trajectory. As we move through the
remaining phases, our focus remains on quality, stewardship of
resources, and staying aligned with the needs and vision of the
Congregational Church of Eastford.

For me personally, one of the greatest blessings of this project has
been the relationships that have formed along the way. Working with the
pastors, church leaders, town officials, and many members of the
congregation has been a privilege. The conversations on site, the shared
problem solving, and the steady encouragement from the church family
have turned this from a construction job into a partnership. Those
relationships have made the long days worthwhile and have reminded me
again and again why this building matters.

This new church is more than a structure rising from a cleared piece of
land. It is a sign of perseverance after loss, a place where future
generations will gather, worship, and serve, and a visible reminder that
God is still at work in Eastford. I am grateful to play a small part in
this story and look forward to the day --- not too far off now --- when
the doors are opened and the community is welcomed into its new home.
