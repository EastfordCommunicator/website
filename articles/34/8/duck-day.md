*Six more weeks of winter predicted by Eastford's own
forecaster*

EASTFORD --- It may not be the prediction people were hoping for, but it
is official nonetheless. According to Scramble the Duck, a shadow has
been seen --- and six more weeks of winter is on the horizon.

Eastford's own annual avian weather prognosticator made his prediction
in frigid conditions on Monday, Feb. 2, at the Ivy Glenn Memorial, to a
mixed reaction from locals who had been locked in a stretch of below
freezing temperatures for what seemed like weeks.

Nevertheless, Scramble emerged and spoke his prediction to his handlers
--- brothers Isaac and Benjamin Torcellini, and siblings Karissa and
T.J. Howard --- who translated his thoughts for the people in attendance
in person and online. T.J. Howard held up the official declaration while
his sister read the poetic prophecy aloud as Scramble declared his
intentions:

> "As ice stays thick on the frozen pond,<br>
> I, Scramble, come out and look beyond.<br>
> I see icicles glitter and snow falling ahead.<br>
> I let out a sigh and shake my head.<br>
> The winter's been hard. The snow has been piling.<br>
> When will it end? I quacked, smiling.<br>
> Will there be puddles or will there be shovels?<br>
> Will there be mowing, or will there be plowing?<br>
> The sun looks pale.<br>
> The wind is blowing cold.<br>
> The spring will stay quiet.<br>
> The winter is bold!<br>
> Six more weeks of winter to behold!"<br>

The tradition of "Duck Day" in Eastford dates back to 2015. Over the
years, the alternate option to Groundhog Day has garnered national and
international attention, as news outlets from around the world have
picked up Scramble's predictions over the years. Local state government
officials have also made it a routine to stop by and officially support
Scramble's efforts, as State Rep. Pat Boyd and State Sen. Jeff Gordon
stopped by on Feb. 2 to present Scramble with a citation from the
Connecticut General Assembly, noting his accuracy and thanking him for
his service to the community.

According to the Torcellinis, Scramble boasts a 100-percent accuracy
rating, something that can't be said for other prognosticators.

"With his record of 100-percent accuracy, Scramble is trustworthy and
his predictions should be heeded, he said. "The quacks that we interpret
for you today have a legacy of accuracy. They come from a duck who is
well-educated, spends his time enjoying and studying the weather, and
above all is working to maintain the honor of his prognostication
discipline."
