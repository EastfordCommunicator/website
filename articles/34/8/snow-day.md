---

EASTFORD --- The town experienced snowfall like it hadn't seen in years
on Sunday, Jan. 25 and Monday, Jan. 26, as Winter Storm Benjamin rolled
through Connecticut, leaving behind upwards of 18 inches of snow in
Eastford. While adults may have groaned about clearing snow and driving
on roads, children celebrated a snow day on Monday, Jan. 26, and the
*Communicator* wasn't about to pass up the opportunity to collect photos
of the big day! Enjoy these reader-submitted photos from around town!
