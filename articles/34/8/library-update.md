In honor of Dr. Seuss' birthday, the library will celebrate "Read Across
America Week" March 2-7. There will be drop-in crafts and activities
available as we encourage our patrons of all ages to read every day.

As winter draws to a close, we will also be celebrating the warmer
weather and longer daylight hours. Spring is right around the corner,
and there is a lot to look forward to in the upcoming months. Stay
tuned!
