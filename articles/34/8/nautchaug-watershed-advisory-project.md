title: Natchaug Watershed Advisory Project Seeks Input
---

What most of us know about living in the Natchaug watershed is just how
abundant, unique, and diverse the natural surroundings of this region
are. We appreciate the variety of ecosystems and the extensive areas to
work and play. Making a living in forestry and agriculture have been
passed down through the generations.

A watershed includes the land that drains into a waterbody, like a
stream, lake or river and eventually the ocean. As water or snow melt
drains across the land, it carries with it various materials referred to
as non-point source pollution, impacting the health of the watershed.
The land and water in the Natchaug Regional watershed drain into three
major rivers (the Natchaug, Mount Hope and Fenton Rivers) and is the
source of drinking water for approximately 22,000 residents in
Willimantic and parts of Mansfield and Windham. The Natchaug is
recognized as an overall healthy watershed due to the high amount of
forest cover (about 75 percent), minimal development impacts, and a good
deal of state, town, land trust and privately owned protected land.

Federal and state environmental agencies continue to show strong support
for the area. The Eastern CT Conservation District (ECCD) has been
awarded EPA grant funding administered by the CT Department of Energy
and Environmental Protection (DEEP) to create and facilitate a Natchaug
Healthy Watershed Advisory Board (NWAB) for eight of the watershed towns
--- Ashford, Chaplin, Eastford, Mansfield, Union, Willington, Windham
and Woodstock. This is the first EPA-funded "healthy watershed"
initiative undertaken in Connecticut focusing on preventing pollution
before it happens and reducing common types of non-point source
pollution including bacteria, nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.),
sediment, salt, petroleum products, PFAS, heavy metals, pesticides and
trash.

A history of conservation cooperation exists in the Natchaug watershed,
demonstrated by multiple municipal efforts to establish Greenways and
the signing, by the eight watershed towns, of The Natchaug River Basin
Conservation Compact in 2011. In it, the municipalities agreed to work
cooperatively to balance conservation and growth in the watershed,
demonstrating that residents, businesses, and academic institutions of
the Natchaug watershed towns are cognizant of the special location in
which they live.

Now in 2025, all eight towns' first selectmen have signed Memorandums of
Understanding with ECCD showing their leaderships' support for the
Natchaug project. It takes a cooperative regional effort using
thoughtful land use planning and non-regulatory, cost-effective means to
protect, and restore where needed, the watershed's natural resources
into the future.

The NWAB and five workgroups have been meeting monthly since the project
kickoff last April to focus on implementing recommendations from the
2020 Natchaug Healthy Watershed Protection Plan, including identifying
stressors and solutions to protect natural resources and water quality.
Workgroups include forestry and open space, healthy residential
landscapes and septic systems, riparian wildlife corridors and
pollinator pathways, cold water stream habitat and connectivity and
municipal land use officials education. The Advisory Board and
workgroups continually welcome municipal representatives, non-profit
organizations, lake and outdoor recreational groups, local businesses,
farmers and residents with experience in any of the topics alongside an
interest to work with neighbors on opportunities such as planning
workshops, creating brochures, planting native vegetation and more!

Please reach out to Maura Robie, Natural Resource Specialist at ECCD, at
<maura.robie@comcast.net> to participate. Go to ECCDs website
conservect.org/eastern and look under 'Watershed Committees' for more
information and educational events. Join us in sustaining our shared
home, the Natchaug watershed, for generations to come! This project was
funded, in part, by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The
funding is administered by the Connecticut Department of Energy and
Environmental Protection.
