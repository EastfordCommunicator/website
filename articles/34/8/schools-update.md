Recently, you may have seen social media posts recognizing local schools
and districts for their performance on the 2024--2025 Connecticut Next
Generation Accountability System, including being named Schools of
Distinction. We are proud to share that Eastford Elementary School has
earned this designation. Being named a School of Distinction reflects
consistent, meaningful success in supporting students academically,
socially, and emotionally, and highlights the collective efforts of
students, staff, and families.

Connecticut's Next Generation Accountability System is a comprehensive
framework that uses 12 indicators to tell the story of how well schools
are preparing students for success in college, careers, and life. While
academic achievement remains an important component, the system places a
strong emphasis on student growth over time, which provides a more
accurate picture of learning than a single test score or moment in time.
Growth measures help ensure that schools are recognized for helping all
students make progress, regardless of where they begin.

These indicators fall into several broad areas, including academic
achievement and growth, student engagement and wellness, and long-term
readiness. In addition to state assessment results, the system considers
factors such as chronic absenteeism, access to physical fitness, and
participation in the arts. Research consistently shows that students who
attend school regularly, maintain healthy habits, and engage in a
well-rounded curriculum are more likely to succeed academically and
beyond. Eastford Elementary's recognition as a School of Distinction
reflects strong performance across these areas, demonstrating a balanced
and student-centered approach to learning.

Family partnerships play a critical role in this success. Establishing
routines at home and valuing education, health, and wellness are
essential foundations for learning. While students are with us for just
over six hours each school day, their growth and development are shaped
by the combined efforts of school and home. Well-rested, well-fed, and
healthy children are better positioned to fully engage in learning, and
strong collaboration between families and educators strengthens outcomes
for all students.

At Eastford Elementary School, staff take a holistic approach to
teaching and learning. This work begins with intentional reflection ---
examining our strengths, identifying areas for growth, and being willing
to adapt as the needs of students and families evolve. We have systems
in place to support both academic learning and social-emotional
development, but we know that meaningful growth is only possible when
strong relationships come first. By fostering positive connections among
staff, students, and families, we create a school environment that is
supportive, responsive, and focused on continuous improvement. We strive
to be a warm, caring community that both nurtures and challenges
students to reach their potential.

Teaching, learning, and staying engaged in this work requires
dedication, perseverance, and shared responsibility. By continuing to
work together, we can build on this recognition and ensure that Eastford
Elementary remains a place where students thrive.

Congratulations to our students, educators, and families on this
well-earned honor. We are proud of our accomplishments and grateful for
the collective commitment that led to Eastford Elementary School being
named a School of Distinction --- and we look forward to continuing this
important work together.
