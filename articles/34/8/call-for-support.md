title: We need your support!

We are entering budget time --- that time when the town's government
begins the budget process and its deliberations toward finalizing both
the town's and Board of Education's budgets for presentation at the Town
Meeting later in the spring.

It is always a complex and difficult time for the Board of Selectmen,
reviewing the many, justifiably valid requests from a multiplicity of
constituencies to arrive at a judicious final budget that meets the
needs of the town in the fiscal year ahead while fulfilling its
citizen-driven mandate to govern within given fiscal parameters.

Among those budget requests the Board of Selectmen has received this
year is one from the Board of Directors of The Eastford Communicator
LLC. The board is seeking a line-item allocation of $7,500 to continue
its operation. This is an increase over the $5,000 allocated by the
selectmen in the current budget. These town funds are allocated for
*Communicator* operating expenses, and when melded into the funds
derived from advertising revenue and donations, comprise the totality of
funding needed to publish the *Communicator* each month and get it into
every home in Eastford.

The Communicator Board of Directors has consistently received positive
feedback regarding the newspaper. Residents have expressed their
appreciation for having a local source of news once again. Transitioning
to a monthly publication schedule has proven highly successful, with
readers expressing enthusiasm about receiving the *Communicator* every
month.

If you are among our readers who welcome receiving the *Communicator*
each month, we would ask that you make this known to the Board of
Selectmen and that you express your support for our Fiscal Year 2026-27
line item budget request. Public support is critical to our continued
success as an exemplar of community journalism.

The Board of Selectmen is reachable at (860) 974-0133, ext. 3. The First
Selectman may be reached by e-mail at
<firstselectman@townofeastford.com>. Or, you can drop them a note at 16
Westford Rd., Eastford, CT 06242.

Many, many thanks!

Atty. Michele Ann Palulis, *Communicator* Board of Directors Chairman

Arthur W. Brodeur, *Communicator* Editor-in-Chief
