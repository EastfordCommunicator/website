- Spring Clean-up: The Trustees will conduct a general clean-up of the
cemetery grounds after March 15, on a date to be determined. Seasonal
flowers, wreathes, logs and other objects will be removed at the time of
the clean-up. If you wish to recycle your own decorations, you should do
so at your earliest convenience, but prior to March 15.
- Landscaping/Mowing Season: After March 15, live flowers may be planted
or placed in plastic pots within 12" of the base of the monument.
Artificial flowers, ornaments, and other objects are not allowed during
the mowing season and will be removed because the objects are a risk to
the groundskeepers and their machines.

Glenn.
