I would like to tell you about a wonderful plant that blooms in late
winter and very early spring. It is one of the most beautiful plants in
a garden, and it comes up at a time when there is nothing but remnants
of snow and mud. It's called snowdrops (Galanthus). Let me tell you
about them.

With their nodding white blooms and fresh green foliage, snowdrops
herald the end of winter. Planted en masse, they light up the early
garden. There are several species and many hundreds of cultivars of
snowdrops. You can tell them apart by their green and yellow markings.
You can create a wonderful display with widely available, affordable
types of Galanthus purchased at your local garden center.

Snowdrops are perennial, so they will flower year after year. Once
established, they are low maintenance and mostly trouble free. They do
need the right growing conditions to thrive. The bulbs can be planted in
autumn at the same time as daffodils. You can also plant container-grown
snowdrops in late winter if they are available at the garden center.

Plant them in moist but well-drained soil. A position in part shade is
ideal as they will receive some sunlight and rain in spring but have
cover in summer. A spot under a canopy of a deciduous tree is perfect.
They look fantastic in large drifts and naturalize well.

To increase your number of plants for an impressive display, lift clumps
of snowdrops just after flowering, and before the foliage turns yellow.
Divide the clumps into smaller groups and replant them right away at the
same depth, further apart. You can also let them set seed automatically.
Once established, Galanthus need little care. After flowering, let the
foliage die back on its own (same as you do with daffodils). I hope you
get to add this excellent perennial bulb to your late winter, early
spring plant collection. You will be very happy you did.
