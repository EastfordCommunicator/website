Happy soon-to-be spring!

There is an energy-saving initiative called Earth Hour which takes place
at the end of this month. Founded in 2007, Earth Hour occurs on
Saturday, March 28, at 8:30 p.m. local time. Participants around the
world are asked to switch off their non-essential lights for one whole
hour. This campaign hopes to send a strong message about energy
conservation and to inspire participants to reconnect with nature.

During these 60 minutes, families and communities are asked to do
something positive for the planet, such as re-thinking your outdoor
light use, developing a plan to encourage pollinators in your town,
discussing connecting to nature with friends and family, making choices
to fight comate change, or spurring on the expansion(s) of advocacy at a
local event.
