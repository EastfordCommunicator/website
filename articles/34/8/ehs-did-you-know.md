Did you know that at a Town Meeting in August 1849, Eastford selectmen
authorized an order for $100 for hiring a competent surveyor to obtain
the best route for a railroad from Willimantic to the Massachusetts line
through Mansfield, Chaplin, Eastford, Woodstock and Thompson?

A charter had already been obtained from the CT General Assembly, but
the line was never built. In the 1880's more surveying work was done to
assess the feasibility of a line from Willimantic through Eastford to
Southborough, Mass. This route likely would have travelled along a
similar path as today's Route 198, but no railroad connecting through
Eastford was ever built. Eventually, a proper road was built from
Phoenixville to Abington (now today's Route 44) to provide access to
the train station in Abington.
