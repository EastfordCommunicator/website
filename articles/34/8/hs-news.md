emergencies, will come from the number ending in 1196.

Informational SMS/text: (860) 743-3734

Emergency SMS/text: (860) 200-1196

Parents may receive messages from different numbers depending on the
region they're in. In this case, look out for a text that begins with
the code "WA" to ensure it is from The Woodstock Academy.

While these numbers are not able to receive replies, we encourage you to
save them both to your contacts. This change is necessary to enhance the
reliability and security of our communications and aligns with the
industry standard. Thank you for your understanding and attention to
this matter.
