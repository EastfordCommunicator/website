title: Conservation and Historic Preservation Commission Update
---

The Eastford Conservation and Historic Preservation Commission meets on
the first Tuesday of every month at 7 p.m. at the Town Office Building
unless otherwise announced.

We encourage folks to get interested and get involved in the
conservation and preservation of our abundant natural resources and open
spaces in town. We discuss ongoing and upcoming events and opportunities
for residents to get involved in. We work with Eastford Elementary to
promote outdoor activities and wise habitat management. We are
scheduling our spring bluebird box project where the eighth graders
assist the third graders in making bluebird boxes that they can keep!
This spring, we have plans to rebuild the bridge on the Askew Trail and
will be looking for assistance with that. We are also working closely
with the Natchaug Healthy Watershed Group (administered by the Eastern
CT Conservation Commission and the DEEP).

Please check us out on the town website and also the ECHPC Facebook
page. Come see what we're all about!
