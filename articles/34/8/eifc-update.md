Thanks to all who are taking things safely when it comes to the amount
of snow, ice, and falls that are occurring. Winter is far from over. We
ask all to take a few minutes, safely, to clean around your mailboxes
and especially make your house numbers visible from the road in the
event you need to call "911." Clearing a path from your driveway to your
house entry is critical should you need to be transported to the
hospital.

The department responded to 22 "911" calls during the month of January.

Welcome our newest member, Gavin Driscoll, to the department.

In addition to the monthly business meeting, truck checks, and line
officers meeting, drills were held on SCBAs, mandatory
airborne/bloodborne pathogens, sexual harassment in the workplace and
HIPAA.

Tip of the Month: The Hidden Risks of Hearing Loss -- Communicating
with Deaf or Hard of Hearing: Most know that hearing loss in older
adults is common, as well as cognitive decline. What is frightening is
that seniors that struggle with hearing loss can experience cognitive
decline nearly 40 percent faster than those without. Taking steps to
protect or address hearing loss can also protect your health and overall
independence.

Tips for speaking and speechreading: Face the hard of hearing person,
maintain eye contact, speak normally and clearly, not too slowly or
loudly, do not exaggerate mouth movements.

Tips for communicating through writing: Keep writing simple and to the
point, look for meaning in the person's message, ignore any grammatical
errors.

Tips for Dementia: Mild hearing loss can double dementia risk. Moderate
loss can triple risk, and severe hearing impairment can be five times
more likely to develop dementia.

Tips for Risk of Falls: Evan a mild hearing loss triples the risk of
falls.

Tips for Long-Term Care: One third of older adults that are hospitalized
from a serious fall injury do not return home and require admission to
long-term care.

Tips for Diabetes: Diabetes can have a significant impact on hearing
health. High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels and nerves
in the inner ear, which can lead to hearing difficulties.

Recommendation: Research shows that restoring hearing loss with hearing
aids may not only improve the quality of life, but could also extend it.
