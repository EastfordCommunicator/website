I would like to extend my sincere thanks to our Public Works and
Transfer Station attendants for their hard work during the recent cold
and snowy weather. Their dedication to their jobs and to the residents
of Eastford does not go unnoticed. Thank you, Ben, James, Zach, Mike,
and David! We also want to wish Zach all the best as he begins his new
full-time position and thank him for his great service to our community.

The Board of Selectmen has begun the budget process. Meeting dates are
posted on the Town of Eastford website, and all meetings are open to the
public. Our focus will be on maintaining essential services, continuing
to review and adjust town wages, and addressing infrastructure needs, as
well as managing rising utility and insurance costs and state-mandated
rebates.

We currently have a very part-time opening for an Office Assistant. This
position is four hours per week and involves supporting the
Administrative Assistant with mandated reporting, filing, and other
office tasks. We are also seeking an Assistant for the Assessor, a
position totaling approximately 150 hours in the fall. We plan to hire
one individual to fulfill both roles. Office Assistant hours are
flexible, and we hope to increase those hours in July. If you are
interested, please apply at the Selectmen's Office or e-mail your resume
to <emily.john@eastfordct.gov>.

Planning is underway for our Memorial Day event. Terry Cote has
generously offered to serve once again as chair --- thank you, Terry! I
have received approval for a military flyover, and we will feature a
surprise speaker in honor of America's 250th Anniversary. Please save
the date --- Monday, May 25, 2026.
