Hello Eastford!

As I write this, we are still in the grip of winter cold and everything
is under a mantle of snow. I have seen some maple tree taps, but other
than that, all seems pretty much dead and gone. But living in New
England we know that's not true. In fact, I bet we are all certain that
by May everything will be crazy alive --- dazzling green grass, flowers,
trees budded out, those glorious light green new leaves soaking up the
spring sunshine. New life springs forth from what appeared to be dead
and gone. New life.

It was in the springtime about 20 centuries ago that Jesus, the Son of
God, gave His life for us, dying a horrible death on a cross where He
paid the price for our brokenness before God. That was on a Friday
afternoon. To His devoted followers, it seemed as all was lost. Dead is
dead, right? Irreversible. Final. But on Sunday morning Jesus rose from
the dead. Life from death. New life. This incredible (and true) event is
the foundation of all of Christian faith. We celebrate Jesus'
resurrection on Easter every year.

I recall a conversation I had a while ago with a checkout clerk in a
sporting goods store. It was spring and I was buying some fishing
tackle. She seemed tired. I asked her how her day was going, and she
confirmed that it was exhausting. I asked her how much longer her shift
was. She said, "It just started. This is my second job. I already worked
eight hours at my other job. It's the only way I can make ends meet."

I responded, "Sounds like your life is a real handful right now."

Her reply was, "If only I could have a new life..."

How about you? Would a new life be a blessing? New life is what is on
offer from Jesus. He died on that cross to wipe our slate clean -- no
guilt, no shame -- the package of complete and utter forgiveness. All
motivated by God's love for you. Amazing. Jesus died and He rose again.
So can we.

Maybe you already know this truth and are a follower of Jesus. Maybe
not. In any case, let me invite you to attend an Easter worship service
in a Christian church this year. Our services will be at sunrise (on top
of the hill at 8 Church Rd. at 6:30 a.m.) and at 10 a.m. in the Eastford
School gym. Not only will we celebrate what Jesus did long ago, but we
will encounter Him in the moment. You see, Jesus is alive! Come and
celebrate new life --- with us or at the church of your choosing. Happy
Easter.
