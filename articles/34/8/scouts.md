title: What's New with Scout Troop 92?
---

ASHFORD/EASTFORD --- Boy Scouts of America Troop 92 enjoyed spending
time outdoors at the Klondike Derby at the end of January. It was bitter
cold, but sunny and no wind. There was plenty of snow on the ground, so
that was good. Due to extremely low temperatures the Troop did not stay
overnight. It is really hard to cook outdoors when the temperature is 14
degrees below zero!

Activities at the Klondike Derby included fire starting, first aid,
backpack survival, shelter building and others. At the end of the day,
20 patrols competed in a dogsled race on a course around the
snow-covered parade field. There were no injuries.

The February Scout meeting was devoted to rank advancement, as will the
March meeting. Scout ranks give youth hands-on experience with
leadership roles.

Troop 92 is scheduling a white-water rafting trip for this summer on the
Deerfield River in Massachusetts. Prerequisite to attend is to have
earned the Kayaking Merit Badge.

In March, Cub Scouts will participate in the annual Pinewood Derby
competition. This is one of Cub Scouts' most popular activities. Cars
are gravity powered, and run on a timed track. Competition is fierce!
Winners are eligible to go on to compete in regional competition.

Troop meetings are the second and last Tuesday of the month at St.
Philip's Recreation Center in Ashford. New members are welcome.
