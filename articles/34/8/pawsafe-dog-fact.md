Did you know? The dog's nose print is so unique and detailed that it can
be used to identify specific dogs? It's like our fingerprint!

## Dog of the Month

Meet Tater! This sweet 9-week-old Great Pyrenees mix girl is as friendly
as she is adorable. She's growing fast and will be a large, majestic dog
once fully grown, so she'll need room to stretch her legs. Her family
should enjoy plenty of brushing to keep that gorgeous coat in top shape.
True to her Pyr roots, Tater has a gentle, loving nature. She's the kind
of dog who will adore her family, shed generously, and watch over her
home with calm, loyal devotion.

Tater is microchipped, medically up to date, and ready to meet her
match. Come meet her at PawSafe, 348 Old Colony Rd., Eastford. Learn
more at [www.pawsafe.org].
