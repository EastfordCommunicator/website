As March unfolds, many of us are ready to see winter loosen its grip and
give way to signs of new life. That anticipation fits perfectly with
what Christians look forward to most this season, namely Resurrection
Sunday, also commonly known as Easter.

The days leading up to Resurrection Sunday invite us to reflect not only
on the joy of the empty tomb, but also on the cost that came before it.
This year, we are grateful to join together with the Congregational
Church of Eastford for a combined Good Friday service at 7 p.m., as we
remember Christ's sacrifice and the meaning of the cross. It is a
meaningful opportunity for our town's churches to gather as one.

Then, on Sunday, April 5, we will celebrate Resurrection Sunday
(Easter), the heart of the Christian faith. We will begin the morning
with a Sunrise Service at 6:30 a.m. at Buell's Orchard, followed by
breakfast at Eastford Baptist Church. Later that morning, we will gather
again for our Resurrection Sunday Worship Service at 10:30 a.m.

Resurrection Sunday is more than a tradition. It is a message of eternal
hope. It reminds us that death does not have the final word, that
forgiveness is real, and that new and everlasting life is possible.

Whether you have attended church for years or haven't been in quite some
time, you are warmly invited to join us as we remember, reflect, and
rejoice together.
