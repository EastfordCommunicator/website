EASTFORD --- On Thursday, June 12, Eastford Elementary School said
goodbye to twenty-two graduating eighth-grade students in its annual Graduation
Ceremony. Students looked back on their near decade together, with a
speech by Class President Wes DePercio, and a slideshow of memories
prepared by Class Historian Holly Dubina. Superintendent Donna Leake and
Principal Carole McCombe each wished the students well as they moved on
to high school in the fall as the Class of 2029. Twelve will attend The
Woodstock Academy; six will attend E.O. Smith; three will attend Ellis
Tech; and one will attend Killingly High School.
