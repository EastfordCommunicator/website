title: Bowen's Memorial Field Committee Working on Plan for Field Improvements
---

EASTFORD --- The Bowen's Memorial Field Committee is a group of town
members who are dedicated to returning the charm to the Bowen's Memorial
Field. This town-appointed committee has been meeting since earlier this
year with the goal of creating playable ball fields for local children
to enjoy for many years to come.

Currently, the committee is evaluating the land and working with an
engineer to come up with the best plan possible for the fields.

A big thanks to those individuals who volunteered their time as we look
to fix the fields for the future. Thank you to Northeast Builders
Roofing Co. for the new roof they put on the concession stand and The
Inn at Woodstock for painting the stand.

A sign dedication ceremony (as of this writing) was set for July 26.

The Bowen's Memorial Field Committee meets on the second Thursday of
every month at 6 p.m. in the lower level of the town hall. Any town
members who would like to lend a helping hand are welcome to join.
