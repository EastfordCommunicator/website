As our Summer Reading Program comes to an end, I would like to say thank
you so much to everyone who participated in our love of reading,
learning and gardening. Please stop in as we unwind and enjoy the final
weeks before school begins.

Pictured with this update is Louisa Barry, who made a Spaghetti Garden
Grow Bag sponsored by The Friends of the Eastford Public Library.
