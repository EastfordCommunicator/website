EASTFORD --- Over the span of four days in early June, Eastford
Elementary School eighth graders experienced a field trip that will
leave lasting memories, and they are ready to tell you all about it.

From Tuesday, June 3, to Friday, June 6, 21 EES students and six
chaperones embarked on the school's annual field trip to Washington,
D.C., a trip chock full of history and educational moments. The field
trip was years in the making, as the Eastford School Auction Committee
collects money via the EES Annual Goods and Services Auction each fall
to fund the trip over several years leading up to it. This past trip was
the culmination of those years of fundraising for the Class of 2025, and
*The Eastford Communicator* was along for the ride.

Thanks to teachers and field trip organizers Jennifer Barlow and
Catherine DePercio, the *Communicator* collected quotes and memories
from several students about their experiences on the trip.

After an all-day bus ride from Eastford to Washington, D.C. on Tuesday,
June 3, the group enjoyed dinner before resting up for the first
sightseeing day on Wednesday, June 4 --- which began with a morning
excursion at Arlington National Cemetery. There, the group learned about
the history of the property, while also learning about the more notable
figures from history buried there, including President John F. Kennedy.
The cemetery also has a local connection, as Eastford resident Joseph E.
Phaneuf II is buried there. Phaneuf was a Staff Sergeant in the U.S.
Army when he was killed in Afghanistan in 2006. Students gathered at his
grave in Arlington to pay their respects to a local hero.

The group also visited the Arlington House and witnessed a guard
changeover ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Eighth grader Wes DePercio reflected on his time spent at Arlington
National Cemetery, calling the experience an "eye opener."

"We had an amazing tour guide, who had quite the character," DePercio
said about their guide throughout the trip, Michelle Heller. "We visited
\[John F. Kennedy's\] grave and learned the qualifications of burial at
Arlington. Although the cemetery was quite massive, it was cool and
interesting to see all our fallen comrades and stop to see important
graves. ... Walking around the cemetery was an eye opener to our class
on how we were walking amongst fallen heroes."

After quick stops at the United States Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo
Jima Memorial) and a photo op behind The White House, the group enjoyed
lunch at Chik-fil-A. The group then spent their Wednesday afternoon at
the International Spy Museum, which documents the history of the
intelligence field and espionage and provided an interactive experience
for the students.

Ella Barlow said the Spy Museum was her favorite stop on the entire trip
and detailed the process of exploring the museum.

"There were many different fun parts of the Washington D.C. trip, but my
favorite place that we went to was the Spy Museum," Ella said. "When you
first arrive, you are handed a card that contains all your information.
Then, you travel to the third floor via elevator. Next, there are
computer screens that you tap your card on. The screen will show you
pictures that you will select your favorites from. This will determine
your name and your identity, which are fake. Then you will receive a
mission and a secret codeword. You will be asked what your codeword is
many times throughout the exhibit. This will make sure that the correct
person is reading your mission details and information. There are also
many stations that describe different tactics used by many spies."

"My favorite spot was where you got to take a picture of yourself and
put on different clothing options to conceal your identity," Ella
continued. "There was also a spot where you are given the opportunity to
view a real-life situation and decide whether you would take action or
wait based on the given information. There was another floor where you
could hold on to a bar and see how long you could hang. Finally, you
could try to solve a passcode and open an air vent that you could climb
through."

After dinner, the group joined up with Heller once again to tour several
of Washington D.C.'s most famous monuments, including the World War II
Memorial; The Washington Monument (from a distance); The Vietnam
Veterans Memorial; The Lincoln Memorial; the Korean War Veterans
Memorial; and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial.

Piper Moore described being affected particularly by the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial, both by its design and the adjacent Vietnam Women's
Memorial.

"I remember a few weeks before D.C., we had to look up information and
facts about the different memorials," Moore said. "I got assigned the
Vietnam Memorial. It was cool reading about Maya \[Lin\], the girl who
designed the memorial. When we got to the memorial, I was mesmerized by
the detail in the \[Vietnam Women's Memorial\] statue, hearing our tour
guide explain how the designer used artistic liberty and added a bun for
one of the women."

"Looking at the wall \[of the memorial\] hurt," Moore concluded. "It was
sad to see all the names, all the people and soldiers who sacrificed
their lives. I was glad that at least those names will be remembered
forever."

Allie Beausoleil commented that the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial was
her favorite.

"Out of all the memorials we saw, the one that caught my attention the
most \[was the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial\]," Beausoleil said. "We
went at around 9 p.m., which in my opinion, was the best time to visit.
There weren't any other classes from other schools, which allowed us to
see much better. Additionally, there were lights all around to
illuminate the space to allow people to clearly see the memorial."

"Mrs. Heller explained to us that \[King's body on the memorial\] wasn't
finished because his job wasn't finished," she continues. "One of his
famous quotes was: 'We will be able to hew out of the mountain of
despair a stone of hope.' This is why he is coming out of the mountain
behind him --- he is coming out of that mountain of despair. Our tour
guide also explained that he is facing the Jefferson Memorial because
Jefferson owned slaves, and he is looking towards \[the Franklin Delano
Roosevelt Memorial\] because they both had aspiring goals for the
country and its civil rights. This memorial, as well as everything else
we experienced on this trip, was memorable."

Thursday, June 5 began with a quick trip to the Jefferson Memorial and
the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial. The group then planned an
afternoon at three Smithsonian museums --- the National Air and Space
Museum; the National Museum of Natural History; and the National Museum
of American History. The main group split into subgroups to explore the
museums they most wanted to see

Brooke Perry explained that her favorite experience was the National
Museum of American History.

"Washington D.C. was a great trip," Perry said. "My personal favorite
part was going to the American History Museum. This museum displayed
different parts of American culture, events, and more. The first section
we saw was about entertainment and was also my favorite. It had many
items from movies and music, such as the red slippers Dorothy wore in
"The Wizard of Oz," and an outfit Selena \[Quintanilla-PÃ©rez\] wore at a
concert. There was a film about racial stereotypes that I and some other
students on the trip enjoyed watching because of the humor that was in
it. Another part that was interesting was the First Ladies part, where
it displayed many of the dresses first ladies had worn \[throughout the
years\]."

Mitchell Norman explained that his favorite experience came at the
National Air and Space Museum.

"A large portion of the D.C. trip was spent in the Smithsonian museums
on Thursday," Norman said. "This was my favorite portion of the trip, as
it not only was my biggest interest, but was also put together very
well. The museum had a ton of attractions. We didn't even get to see
some, as part of the museum was closed off. It was all good though, as
the exhibits we did see were downright amazing! I remember vividly one
exhibit that took amazing detail to describe the solar system. There
were models and description pieces that did an amazing job describing
everything. We even got to see very neat models of rovers and landers
that actually went into space. In the center of the room was a large
screen that cycled between different planets and moon surface. This had
even more explanations of temperature, gravity levels, and so many more
cool things about space locations."

Nora Miller described her time at the Museum of Natural History was
enjoyable and educational.

"The first museum that my group visited was the Museum of Natural
History," Miller said. "The first place we went to was the dinosaur
area. We saw multiple ginormous fossils looking back at us and learned
many interesting facts about that time period. Next, we went upstairs to
see the gemstones and minerals. We got to see the Hope Diamond, which
was beautiful. In the next connected room, it was extremely crowded with
everyone trying to look at the gems, jewelry and crystals. After that,
we went to the ocean section and learned about somewhat modern and
prehistoric ocean animals."

After reconvening in the late afternoon, the group made their way to
Nationals Park, where they attended a Major League Baseball game between
the Washington Nationals and the visiting Chicago Cubs. The Cubs
defeated the Nationals, 7-1, bringing the day to a close.

Sofia Gillett said she enjoyed the game being a part of the group's
itinerary.

"We did many things on our Washington D.C. trip," Gillett said. "One of
the things we did during our time there was attending a Washington
Nationals game Thursday evening. After going to the Smithsonian. We were
given our tickets, which doubled as our \[voucher\] for dinner. The game
was very enjoyable and I'm glad it was a part of the Washington D.C.
trip."

Friday, June 6 was the final day of the trip, but before leaving, the
group spent the morning at the Smithsonian National Zoo. Though hot and
sunny, the morning was enjoyed by the students, including Mia Kernan,
who explained her joy in seeing the pandas.

"I loved the zoo," Kernan said. "I got to see a panda eat and wrestle a
tree branch. I also saw blue jays and many other kinds of birds."

After lunch, it was time to head back to Eastford, bringing the field
trip to a close. After a day of travel, the bus arrived back at Eastford
Elementary School at around 10 p.m. on Friday, June 6.

It was the perfect exclamation point to not only the end of the school
year, but to the end of the road at Eastford Elementary School for the
Class of 2025, a trip that created memories that will last a lifetime.

"The school's preparation was key to a great trip," said Allie
Beausoleil. "Their contributions were crucial to make our successful
trip. Thanks to that and the contributors to the auction, this trip was
made possible. I want to thank any and everyone involved, regardless of
how small, for making this happen for us."
