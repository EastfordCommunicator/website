On Oct. 18, we will be holding our 4th Annual Fall Extravaganza from 2-4
p.m.

In the midst of teen weekend, teens help to decorate the cabins on the
trick-or-treat trail and are on hand to run games, hand out candy and
happily give tours to visitors at this fun event. Admission is \$5 per
person ages 2 and up. Your admission fee will allow you to enjoy s'mores
and hot chocolate at the fire pit by the pond. We will have other games
to keep our visitors occupied and some sweet treats will be for sale.
The donut eating contest is always a hit. Children aged 2 and up can
also go on the trick-or-treat trail and get an early start on their
Halloween candy collection. No worries about traffic or walking around
in the dark. It is the perfect time to break in this year's costume and
take some great photos. Proceeds benefit the Health Center Renovation.
This is a great family event and it is a good chance to check out our
camp facilities, enjoy the fall foliage and meet some of our staff.

It may be old news, but we were delighted to have State Rep. Pat Boyd
and Gov. Ned Lamont stop by and visit Director Heather Logee at the
camp's booth at the Woodstock Fair in September. Gov. Lamont got lucky
with our "wheel of fortune" and won some WT4H camp merchandise.
