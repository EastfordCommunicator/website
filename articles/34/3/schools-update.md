"The Bulldog Way."

These words are appearing in various locations at Eastford Elementary
School. The three Cs (3Cs) of the Bulldog Way summarize the expectations
of being a staff member or a student at Eastford Elementary School.

The Bulldog Way is grounded in the 3Cs:
- Challenging ourselves (Student Growth and Achievement)
- Caring for each other (Positive Climate and Culture)
- Connecting with Family and Community (Communication and partnerships)

For staff, the expectations of these 3Cs are highlighted in the EES
Strategic Plan:
- Focus Area 1: Student Growth and Achievement (Challenging): We will
implement an engaging, challenging curriculum, aligned with the Eastford
Portrait of a Learner, that supports all students in becoming
independent learners.
- Focus Area 2: Positive Climate and Culture (Caring): We will foster a
nurturing and caring environment for students and staff, building the
skills and knowledge needed for social-emotional growth.
- Focus Area 3: Communication and Partnerships (Communicating): We will
develop and maintain supportive and engaging relationships with families
and community partners that enhance growth and learning.

For students the expectations of the 3Cs are captured in the Portrait of
an Eastford Learner.

All graduates of EES are expected to develop Habits of Success;
recognize their responsibilities as a Global Citizen: become Creative
Problem Solvers, Effective Collaborators, Effective Communicators, and
Critical Thinkers.

Together, all staff and students, focusing on the 3Cs supports the
Eastford Elementary School Vision Statement:

At Eastford, we envision a thriving community where every student is at
the heart of their own learning journey. Our commitment is to foster a
nurturing environment of care, characterized by positive relationships
and open communication. By implementing practices aligned with Core
Standards and the Eastford Portrait of a Learner, we aim to support and
celebrate each student's unique development. Together, we will build a
supportive, inclusive community where every learner is empowered to
achieve their fullest potential.

I hope this brief synopsis of The Bulldog Way highlights the passionate,
collaborative, commitment to the highest quality of learning that exists
at Eastford Elementary School. As always, you are invited to contact me
