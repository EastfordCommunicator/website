Eastford Public Library strives to serve the needs of our community by
providing an inviting space to inspire and support a life-long love of
reading. The school year has begun, and I look forward to seeing our
Eastford Elementary students for monthly story times. These visits truly
encompass our goal of promoting literacy in the community.

Our library is lucky enough to have Jody Blanchette, "bookstagrammer"
extraordinaire, and our Library Board chair. Her outreach allows us the
opportunity to hold many Author Talks. This month, Jody will host a
Murder Mystery Mania author event with not one --- but four --- amazing
authors. Sarah Stewart Taylor, Lucy Burdette, Sarah Strohmeyer, and
return author Tessa Wegert (pictured here with Jody) will be here
Saturday, Oct. 25, at 1 p.m. If you are interested in attending, please
stop in or call to register.

Library hours are Tuesdays, 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to
5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 12
p.m. You may reach us at (860) 974-0125, or by e-mail at
<eastfordpublib@gmail.com>. Upcoming events and programs can be seen on
the town page or on social media.â€¯If you haven't yet, please follow
