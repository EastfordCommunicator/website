Happy Autumn!

Connecticut Audubon and Mass Audubon do a lot of similar nature
programs, promote learning about state-specific wildlife (flora and
fauna), and offer many educational tools via their websites.

One learning tool I really like is the monthly outdoor almanac that Mass
Audubon publishes each month. It's easy to take a quick glance at it
before heading outside, or a simple way to engage youngsters and teens
into learning about seasonal changes (September and October's bird
migration patterns, flowering plants and mushrooms, moon phases, fall
foliage, critters gathering food for hibernation, etc.). You can print
the outdoor almanac from the Mass Audubon website at the beginning of
each month or view it online via their social media platforms.

[Look for the most recent outdoor almanac here](https://www.massaudubon.org/nature-wildlife/outdoor-almanac).
