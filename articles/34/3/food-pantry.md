We are here to help! The Eastford Food Pantry is located at the Eastford
Baptist Church, 133 Union Rd., in Eastford.

October pantry hours are Monday, Oct. 6, 8-11 a.m. and Wednesday, Oct.
22, 2-4 p.m. We serve Eastford residents who are in need of supplemental
food assistance. All guests are treated with confidentiality.

Thank you so much to all who have donated food, money or home goods to
the pantry. We welcome donations of non-expired, non-perishable food,
toiletries, new home goods and monetary gifts to help us continue serving our neighbors. Every can and
dollar makes a difference! Drop off locations are Bowen's Garage and the Eastford Town
Office Building.
