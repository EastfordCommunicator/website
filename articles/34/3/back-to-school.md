title: EES Students Return to School for a New Year
---

EASTFORD --- And just like that, summer is over. Eastford Elementary
School welcomed its students back to class on Wednesday, Aug. 27,
providing plenty of opportunities for parents to snap some pictures of
their kids as they embarked on another year of learning. With this in
mind, *The Communicator* asked its readers to submit their best "back to
school" photos of their kids, and you did not disappoint! From all of us
at the *Communicator*, we wish all students a fantastic year back at
school!

Hayleigh was ready for her first day, and her mother, Christa, made sure
to send along the following message as well: "Our Hayleigh is 'blooming'
into 5th grade this year! She may be heading off to class, but she still
stopped to 'petal' around with the hydrangeas on her first day. With her
Crocs in full charm mode and a backpack big enough to 'leaf' nothing
behind, she's ready to grow, learn, and blossom all year long."
