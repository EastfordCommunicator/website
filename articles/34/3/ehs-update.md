Did you know that the Eastford Historical Society Annual Meeting was
held on Thursday, Sept. 4, in the lower level of the Town Office
Building? We were pleasantly surprised to see such a great turnout at
our meeting/presentation. Every seat in the house was filled!

Of special note, at the conclusion of the business meeting, officers for
the new year were elected as follows:

- President: Phil Finch
- Vice President: Linda Torgeson
- Secretary: Toni Doubleday
- Treasurer: Heather Douglas
- Historian: Tom Latham

The business meeting was followed by a very informative,
well-researched, slide show presentation by Phil Finch documenting the
history of the Air Line Trail. The presentation was very well received
by all in attendance! At the conclusion of the presentation, members and
guests gathered to enjoy conversation and refreshments.

We were very pleased to receive positive comments from numerous
attendees.

Please consider showing your support by becoming a member of the

Also, we invite you to visit the Historical Society Museum located at 65
John Perry Rd., open every second and fourth Sunday, from 2 to 4 p.m.,
