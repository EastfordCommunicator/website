*Editor's note: In advance of this year's Municipal Election on Tuesday, Nov. 4, the Eastford Communicator requested that all candidates on the ballot complete a
questionnaire to better inform the voters of Eastford before they head out to the polls. To ensure fairness of coverage, each candidate was asked the same three questions
with the same 75 word limit per question, and given the same deadline for submission. For those races that are contested, the order and placement of each candidate's
profile was chosen at random. Constable candidate Nathaniel Fabian declined to participate in this questionnaire. Some answers were edited due to space limitations.*

## First Selectman

### Deb Richards, Republican (Cross Endorsed)

![Deb Richards](/assets/images/34-4-deb-richards.jpg)

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"Having served four years as Eastford's first selectman, I've
demonstrated steady, effective leadership. Each year, we passed the
budget on the first vote and secured $4.8 million for bridge projects,
plus $346,000 in STEAP and other state funding. I remain committed to
practical, community-focused solutions and will continue working closely
with residents to address Eastford's challenges. With experience,
dedication, and a clear vision, I'm focused on building a strong future
for our town."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"Unfunded mandates and inadequate state support place a heavy burden on
the financial health of small towns. The state applies the same
requirements to small municipalities as it does to large cities ---
without accounting for the vast differences in resources. These
mandates, along with required tax abatements, shift the financial burden
onto local taxpayers. Eastford is facing critical infrastructure needs
that, without reliable state support, could create a greater tax strain
on our residents."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"The Eastford Town Office Building is open four days a week, and I'm
always available by appointment outside of regular hours. I take my
responsibility to the residents of Eastford seriously and, together with
the Board of Selectmen, remain committed to thoughtful, accountable
local governance. Our focus is always on how we can best serve the needs
of our community."


### Michael Schultz, Petitioning Candidate

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I am running for this office because of my strong legal and engineering
background. I am a fiscal conservative, having successfully run a $6
million business. I have lived in town for more than 50 years and I love
it."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"I believe the town needs effective and stable growth."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I intend to campaign at many individual households to get people's
opinions as to what they want the town to provide."


## Selectman

### Ashlyn Ellsworth, Democrat

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I am seeking re-election for the Board of Selectmen because I believe
in Eastford's potential and the work and efforts of our highly dedicated
board and commission members. As a Licensed Master Social Worker, I have
spent my career assessing community needs and understanding the human
impact of policies. I have the skills to collaborate effectively,
advocate for constituents, and understand different perspectives. These
are the qualities needed for an effective selectman."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"Eastford is a small town with unique needs. Elected officials face the
critical challenge of balancing the preservation of our town's unique
characteristics while also progressing us forward to address local
trends and state mandates and initiatives. Officials need to think
critically and collaborate locally and regionally to maximize our
resources and address the improvements our town needs. I believe that if
elected I can help Eastford evolve and thrive without sacrificing its
community identity."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I encourage residents to get involved, attend board and commission
meetings, and communicate with elected officials. All meetings are open
to the public and offer a channel for information and feedback while
also increasing transparency and trust. I welcome constructive dialogue
from constituents as it provides me with a deeper insight into the needs
of our town and the impact of policy. Communication between residents
and elected officials is essential for better, informed decision
making."

### Paul Torcellini, Republican

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I enjoy using my talents and skills to help the town's people and keep
the town running smoothly. With an engineering and project management
background, I have been able to help the town by prioritizing budget
needs, saving money with thoughtful repairs, maintaining infrastructure
that keeps buildings running efficiently, and meeting the needs of staff
and citizens."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"One of the most important issues facing small towns is balancing
budgets with decreasing state and federal funding. This is happening
while 'unfunded' mandates grow. I plan on continuing to assist saving
the town money with minimizing borrowing and continuing to evaluate
expenditures while meeting the needs of the residents. Long-range
planning is key to minimize town debt. Be informed about the decisions
that impact the budget by coming to Board of Selectmen meetings."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I encourage everyone to come to Board of Selectman meetings (typically
the first Monday of the month at 7 p.m.) and provide comments. In
addition, you can reach me through the town website ([eastfordct.gov](https://www.eastfordct.gov/)) or
<selectmantorcellini@townofeastford.gov>. I look forward to hearing your
concerns and ideas about making Eastford a better place."


## Constable

### Arvind Shaw, Democrat

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I am a resident and small farmer from Eastford since 2002. I am a
retired community health executive, and served as the town
representative to Northeast District Department of Health (NDDH) from
2010-2018. I also served the Board of Finance Exploratory Committee in
2021-2022. I am currently serving on the Agricultural Committee. I am an
advocate and like helping community efforts."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"Healthcare and transportation are issues for the community and
improvements in access would significantly improve the quality of life."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"These are my contact details --- <arvindshaw@hotmail.com>, and (860)
974-2636."

### Randal Chinnock, Democrat

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"The term 'constable' has a long history. In the 17th century in
England, it came to mean 'an officer chosen to serve minor legal
process.' It later came to mean 'police officer' (in England). It is an
honorable profession. In Eastford, the role relates to 'minor legal
processes,' but not policing. No particular training is required, which
is a good thing, since we don't get any. My qualifications? Common sense
and keeping calm in emergencies."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"In my mind, the most important issue in our community is, like
everywhere else, civility. Harsh words are sometimes exchanged but, in
general things are pretty civil around here. But I fear for the future.
The amplifying of ugliness on social media, overheated politics, the
normalization of behaviors that we used to consider unthinkable. We all
need to do our part to keep the peace. I try to do my part."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I am generally available when the first selectman calls me. As for
accountability, I expect she'll tell me if I screw up, and I'll do what it takes to make
it right. Being a constable in Eastford is a bit like being Barney Fife from "The Andy
Griffith Show" --- there's not a lot to do, but do your best."

### Christopher Bowen, Republican

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"If re-elected, I would continue to help make the school safer for the
children and families. This will be ongoing as I work with the current
school and town administration."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"Safety is of utmost concern for all residents of Eastford. If
re-elected as constable, I will continue to work with our selectmen to
help make Eastford feel and be safer."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I have been operating the garage between the school and the firehouse
for many years, and I welcome anyone to stop by and have conversation
with me and the crew to move forward in safety for our residents."



## Board of Education

### Lauren Barlow, Republican

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I'm running because I want to give back to my community. I care deeply
about public education. As both a teacher and a parent, I have unique
and helpful perspectives to offer."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"I seek to provide support to our community by being part of making
decisions that best support our community and our school."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I'm available through e-mail and am involved in local church and school
groups. I strive to respond to e-mails promptly."

### Michael Bilica, Democrat

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"Education has always been my top priority, and as a teacher, it is also
my profession. I have been on the PTO, Recreation Commission, and a
leader in Cub and Boy Scouts. I am dedicated to supporting the Town of
Eastford through service, and as the father of two boys who grew up in
this town, I am well qualified to serve on the Board of Education."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"Deciding on which school should be our designated high school for EES
graduates is the most important issue facing our committee this term.
Woodstock Academy has been a great option for generations of students.
However, E.O. Smith has provided a strong alternative and is more cost
effective as well for our taxpayers. I will vote for the choice that
best serves the people of Eastford as we enter into a new contract in
2027."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I represent the people of Eastford as a Board of Education member and
it is my job to do what is best for all of us. Our committee is not
divided by ideology. It is a collegial and friendly group that works
well together. I will serve by continuing to work with my fellow members
and will be responsive to the citizens of Eastford."


### Stephen Bowen, Republican

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I have worked with youth my entire adult life and consider the Board of
Education an extension of that. Children are the future. They are one of
the most important things we can use our time and resources on."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"Getting a quality education for the best value."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I have served on the Board of Education for more than 20 years, and
have always been available to anyone looking to discuss any area of the
Board of Education."


### Nancy Neff, Democrat

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I am a retired public school social worker and dedicated community
advocate. With a career spanning decades in social work, along with
experience as a substitute teacher, paraprofessional, and mental health
advocate, I am uniquely equipped to serve the community and its
students."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"I have been following the discussions about federal funding and I
understand the community's apprehension. As a retired public school
social worker, I've seen firsthand how crucial stable funding is to
providing essential services. My goal is to work seamlessly with the
dedicated individuals already on the board to find effective solutions,
if needed."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"Serving on the Board of Education is a privilege that comes with a
responsibility to be present and accessible. I believe that public
service requires showing up --- not just for official meetings, but for
school events, games, and performances. It's at these functions that we
truly connect with our students, teachers, and families and gain a
deeper understanding of our community's pulse."


## Town Clerk

### Johanna Wolfe, Republican (Cross Endorsed)

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I thoroughly enjoy being Town Clerk. I am motivated by the never-ending
variety of tasks of the position and relish the challenge. I strive to
represent Eastford well in my interactions with other town clerks and
the state. I am well-acquainted with state statutes, having become
Assistant Town Clerk in 2000. I worked in that role for my predecessor,
Melissa Vincent, until her retirement in 2021. I was first elected as
Town Clerk in 2021."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"I think the most important issue facing our community (from a town
clerk's perspective) is ensuring a citizen's right to vote. In 2023,
Connecticut passed the Connecticut Voting Rights Act. Each town clerk is
charged with upholding this law, which includes ensuring proper chain of
custody of early voting ballots at the conclusion of each day of early
voting. Issuing and accounting for applications and ballots is a
centerpiece of the office during election season."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"My office is open to all. If there is a question I can't answer, I will
find someone who is able to provide an answer. I am present during
office hours and willing to help with needs related to land records,
vital records, dog licensing, trade name registration, etc. The Town
Clerk's main responsibility is one of service to the citizens of
Eastford --- and I strive to fulfill that obligation with each personal
encounter."

## Tax Collector

### Christine Hustus, Republican (Cross Endorsed)

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I am running for this office because as a lifelong resident of
Eastford, I have a vested interest in seeing continued success in our
community. I have a strong background in accounting and tax preparation.
I am a Certified CT Municipal Collector, having served for 16 years as
Eastford's Tax Collector."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"A primary concern in tax collection is ensuring payments are made
accurately and on time. Understanding the payment schedule and available
payment options can help taxpayers avoid penalties and administrative
issues. Timely payments support effective budgeting and benefit the
community as a whole. I am committed to performing my duties to the
highest standard for the benefit of the citizens of Eastford."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I am available in person during regular office hours. Taxpayers can
also reach me by phone, e-mail or through the official town website.
Financial records and reports are public information. Collection methods
and rates are transparent and accessible to the public. Have a question
or concern? Give me a call!"


## Town Treasurer

### Martha Burgess, Republican

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I moved to Eastford in 1987, and was happy to raise my family in this
great town. I had a 30-year career in banking, retiring as a Regional
Operational Leader for Connecticut and Massachusetts. I was elected as
your Town Treasurer in 2015, and have had the honor of being in the
position since. I bring my experience, strong communication skills and
my passion for respecting all opinions to the position."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"I am committed to Eastford's financial stability and for the community
to be able to thrive now and in the future. I have worked successfully
with the various town leaders throughout the years, and I truly enjoy
the position."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I can be reached by leaving a message for me at the Town Hall, at (860)
974-0133, ext. 4."


## Board of Assessment Appeals

### Robert Johnson, Democrat

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I have always been a civically minded individual and interested in
local governance (two of the reasons I chose to pursue a degree in
political science during my undergraduate studies). The Board of
Assessment Appeals was, therefore, a natural fit for me since it serves
as an intermediate step between the Assessor's Office and the court
system. We provide an important platform to hear tax-related problems
and do our best to help solve them."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"One of the biggest problems facing our town, and our state for that
matter, is affordability. While a universal solution to that problem is
beyond what we are able to do on the board, we can certainly do our part
to help out the taxpayers and ensure that their assessments are
accurate."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"All Board of Assessment Appeals hearings are open to the public, and
the handbook we adhere to is available on the Eastford town website for
anyone to view. Since I first took on the role of secretary about seven
years ago, I have kept meticulous records for minutes and all other
relevant documentation from our meetings. These are publicly available
for anyone to view via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)."


## Library Board of Trustees

### Mary DeGostin, Republican

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"As a lifelong Eastford resident, I am honored to serve as co-chair of
the Library Board since 2022. In those years, we have worked to bring
amazing authors, programs for kids and adults, and updating library
policies. As a reading intervention teacher at Woodstock Elementary with
11 years of experience, I've seen firsthand the transformative power of
literacy. I have a deep love for reading and a strong desire to empower
people to discover it."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"Keeping our library relevant in a time where technology seems to be
ruling most of our lives is so important. The library should be a place
of multi-media sources for learners of all ages to learn and grow with.
I hope that with a continued tenure on the Library Board, I can help
keep the library a welcoming and relevant place for our community!"

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I try to be as approachable and accessible as I can! I encourage
any/all community members who have concerns about our library to come to
our monthly meetings! Hearing from the community on issues that may
arise with the library is a critical part of keeping communication open
and effective."


### Meghan Martinez, Democrat

1. Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I'm running for the Library Board of Trustees because of the important
role that libraries play in the community. It's clear that the library
is loved by its patrons and an equally important component is a
collaborative relationship with our town officials. As a trained
emergency mental health clinician, I bring a set of skills designed to
foster an open and respectful dialogue. Let's work together to further
our goal of a healthy, sustainable library."

2. What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"Our library is the heart of the community and it cannot survive without
a healthy working relationship with our local government officials. When
I decided to run, I introduced myself to our first selectman, and
together, we found a shared value of dialogue rooted in mutual respect.
We both love Eastford and want to see its rich history continued in our
community institutions. Our common ground centers our work and the way
forward."

3. How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I am blessed to be able to primarily work from home -- right up the
street from the library on Old Colony Road. This means that I typically
have the luxury of flexibility to accommodate all sorts of schedules.
Whether it is meeting in person over quiche at Always Moore, chatting on
the phone, or conversing via your preferred digital platform, I pride
myself on being available to the people that rely on me."

### Seth Budd, Republican

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I am an avid reader who is passionate about serving my town. I have six
years of experience as a trustee on the Library Board."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"I will continue to advocate for Eastford Public Library and support the
dedicated staff, as together, we ensure that the library remains a
thriving part of the community. I am committed to hear out all board
members as we collaborate to fulfill the mission of the library."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I welcome citizens' comments and suggestions, whether one-on-one or at
Library Board meetings. This position is a privilege that I do not take
lightly. I strive to do best by those who have entrusted this
responsibility to me."


### Armen Beermann, Republican

1. *Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I believe public service is critical, both nationally and in the local
community. With a BSc in Architectural Engineering, Master's of
Architecture, Excellent Graduate of the War College, and as an licensed
architect, I was involved in the design, renovation, and construction
administration of several libraries. With this background I have a good
understanding of how libraries can run efficiently and effectively. I
bring my international experience to help broaden Eastford Public
Library's horizons."

2. *What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"We need to engage young adults by providing research tools and
resources that they need at their age and time of life. I would like to
ensure that library books, programs, and services serve a broad spectrum
of the whole community. I'm a strong believer of books in print and I
would like to challenge Eastford to continue to rediscover books and the
other valuable resources available in print."

3. *How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I would encourage citizens to come to Library Board meetings and share
their thoughts, recommendations, suggestions, and ideas. Feel free to
reach out to me personally as well. Meeting dates and times, as well as
agendas and minutes, can be found on the town website."
