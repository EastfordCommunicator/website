The EIFC responded to 22 "911" emergencies in September. We participated
in Fire Prevention Week at the Eastford School.

We now move on to the commemoration of Veterans Day. VA Day, originally
known as Armistice Day, is a federal holiday in the U.S. observed
annually on November 11 to honor our military veterans of the United
States Armed Forces.

On November 11, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson issued a message to his
countrymen on the first Armistice Day to reflect the heroism of those
who died in the country's service. In 1954, Armistice Day was changed to
Veterans Day. Cemeteries around the country display the U.S. flag and
service markers as a symbol of this recognition. Grove Cemetery proudly
honors these heroes. So, when you pass the cemetery, take a second or
two to reflect on what Veterans Day means in securing our freedom.

The major drill in September was Utility Terrain Vehicle (UTV) training.
UTVs are off-road, 4-wheel-drive vehicles used for heavily wooded and
diverse terrains. Initial comprehensive training is to ensure
firefighters are well-prepared to operate a UTV under various
conditions. Initial training includes basic UTV operations,
starting/stopping, maneuvering through difficult terrain, emergency
braking and carrying water. UTVs need to be outfitted properly
considering the special needs of individual departments. Specialized
UTVs can transport water tanks and pumps crucial for firefighting in
remote areas where fire engines can't access, or for search and rescues
where someone could be lost or injured in the woods. Each UTV (one of
which is pictured with this article) is outfitted with medical kits to
provide immediate assistance to victims, reliable two-way radios for
communication, tools and equipment easily accessible during emergencies.
Members are mandated to wear safety gear including helmets, goggles,
boots, long pants, long sleeved shirts or turnout gear and gloves. A
scenario-based drill was held in a heavily wooded area in Eastford,
simulating real-life emergency trails. Regular training and maintenance
of the UTV is as critical as it is for the engine tankers, rescue and
equipment.

Thanksgiving is right around the corner! As you plan your Thanksgiving
menu, don't forget about fire safety. Thanksgiving is a peak day for
home cooking fires. The number of home fires double. By following safety
rules, you will have a delicious and fire safe holiday.
