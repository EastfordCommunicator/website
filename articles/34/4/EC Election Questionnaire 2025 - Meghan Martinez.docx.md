### Meghan Martinez, Democrat

1. Why are you running for this office, and what qualifications or
experiences make you the best candidate?*

"I'm running for the Library Board of Trustees because of the important
role that libraries play in the community. It's clear that the library
is loved by its patrons and an equally important component is a
collaborative relationship with our town officials. As a trained
emergency mental health clinician, I bring a set of skills designed to
foster an open and respectful dialogue. Let's work together to further
our goal of a healthy, sustainable library."

2. What do you see as the most important issue facing our community in
the area you are running? How would you address it if elected?*

"Our library is the heart of the community and it cannot survive without
a healthy working relationship with our local government officials. When
I decided to run, I introduced myself to our first selectman, and
together, we found a shared value of dialogue rooted in mutual respect.
We both love Eastford and want to see its rich history continued in our
community institutions. Our common ground centers our work and the way
forward."

3. How will you make yourself accessible and accountable to the people
you represent?*

"I am blessed to be able to primarily work from home -- right up the
street from the library on Old Colony Road. This means that I typically
have the luxury of flexibility to accommodate all sorts of schedules.
Whether it is meeting in person over quiche at Always Moore, chatting on
the phone, or conversing via your preferred digital platform, I pride
myself on being available to the people that rely on me."
