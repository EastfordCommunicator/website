December is such a busy month, we wanted to share this date with you
ahead of time so you can put it on your calendars now. Join us on Dec.
7, for our annual Lunch with Santa event at the Windham-Tolland 4-H Camp
from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., at 326 Taft Pond Rd. in Pomfret. Have lunch
upstairs in the lodge or just come for a photo with Santa and avoid the
lines at the mall.

Made to order pasta bar, salad, drinks and desserts (gluten free pasta
available). Join us in making holiday crafts, cookies, s'mores and more
and shop our selection of silent auction and raffle items. Tickets
available ahead of time by calling (860) 974-3379, e-mail
<registrar@4hcampct.org> or at the door. No reservations necessary. Cost
is $10 for children up to age 9, $14 for adults and those 10 and older
for lunch, 5x7 photo with Santa, $8. Proceeds go to the Jim Logee
Campership Fund to help a child come to camp that couldn't do so without
some tuition support.

Happy Thanksgiving to you all. It's a wonderful time to catch up with
friends and family and load up on those calories to keep you warm as
winter approaches.
