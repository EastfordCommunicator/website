EASTFORD --- A Woodstock man was arrested last month for a reported
shooting that left a man injured on County Road.

According to information published by the Connecticut State Police Troop
D, on Saturday, Sept. 27, at approximately 8:50 p.m., police received a
911 call reporting a male who had been shot and robbed in Eastford.
Troopers responded to the Eastford Independent Fire Co., where they
located the victim on County Road, suffering from a gunshot wound to the
leg, according to police reports. Emergency medical personnel provided
aid before transporting him to the hospital.

According to police, during the initial investigation, the victim
reported that he arranged to meet an individual known to him only as
"Adoty" through Snapchat for a transaction. Police added that according
to the victim, upon meeting in Woodstock, the suspect entered his
vehicle, produced a handgun, and shot him before fleeing the scene with
another male in a silver Volvo sedan. Due to the nature of this
incident, the investigation was then assumed by Eastern District Major
Crime Detectives.

Detectives secured the victim's vehicle and located a secondary crime
scene on Mill Bridge Road in Woodstock, where evidence was collected,
including suspected marijuana, vape cartridges, clothing, and a
high-capacity, 9 mm magazine.

Through investigative leads, detectives identified the suspect as King
Michael Adoty, 19, of Woodstock, who matched the description provided by
the victim and was previously observed operating a silver 2015 Volvo
S80. In the early morning hours of Sept. 28, Troopers located the
suspect's vehicle at his Woodstock residence. Adoty voluntarily agreed
to accompany detectives to Troop D, where he admitted his involvement in
the shooting during an interview. He further stated that he discarded
the firearm while fleeing the scene.

Based on the investigation and evidence gathered, detectives determined
probable cause to arrest Adoty. He was charged with first-degree
assault; first-degree robbery; second-degree reckless endangerment;
sixth-degree larceny; carrying a pistol without a permit; and illegal
possession of a large-capacity magazine.

Adoty was processed and held on a $250,000 cash/surety bond. The
investigation, as of press time, was still active and ongoing, according
to police.
