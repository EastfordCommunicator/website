*Sentencing begins for two charged in CCE arson*

EASTFORD --- The sentencing process has begun for two charged in
connection to the destruction of the Congregational Church of Eastford
(CCE) more than two-and-a-half years ago.

On Friday, Sept. 5, a male suspect, who was a minor at the time of the
incident but has since turned 19 and was tried as an adult, was
sentenced to 20 years of jailtime (with execution to be suspended after
three years, and probation after five years). In addition, a female
minor (who was also underage at the time of the incident, but has since
turned 19), was due to enter a plea on Oct. 28, which was after *The*
*Communicator's* press deadline.

In practice, the sentencing for the male minor means that despite the
20-year sentence, the person will only serve three years in actual
custody, and the remaining 17 years are suspended. That means those
years will not be served unless the person violates probation or commits
another crime. After being released from those three years in custody,
the person must complete five years of probation, under supervision and
with conditions (such as regular check-ins, no new offenses, etc.).
However, if they violate probation or reoffend, the court can re-impose
some or all of that suspended time.

The sentencing brings to a conclusion a case that goes back to April 23,
2023, when the Congregational Church of Eastford, then located at 8
Church Rd., burned to the ground in an overnight fire. Connecticut State
Police Troop D, along with the Connecticut State Police Fire &
Explosives Investigation Unit (FEIU), Eastern District Major Crimes, and
federal agents from the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms,
conducted the investigation that led to the arrest of the two
then-minors, who were also connected to a similar incident in South
Windsor and a break in and small fire at Crystal Pond Park in Woodstock,
police said.

On Sept. 8, 2023, the juvenile male was charged with first-degree arson,
third-degree burglary, first-degree criminal mischief and reckless
endangerment. On Sept. 27, 2023, the juvenile female was charged with
first-degree conspiracy to commit arson, third-degree burglary,
first-degree criminal mischief, and first-degree reckless endangerment.

In the more than two-and-a-half years since the fire, CCE has since
purchased land on John Perry Road, and construction continues on a new
building, which is currently planned to open sometime next summer. CCE
Pastor Mike Moran, in a written column exclusive to the *Communicator*
back in June, expressed his belief that despite the tragic loss of the
building, God has used this situation to bless his congregation.

"Our time without a building has been one of great blessings," he wrote
in June. "Our church family has grown substantially, and we are thriving
in every way."

In a message written to his congregation on Sept. 5, and provided
directly from him to the *Communicator,* Moran stated that he was able
to make a statement in court at the sentencing earlier that day, which
concluded with remarks that expressed his forgiveness that is a hallmark
of the Christian faith.

"It is our heart to forgive \[you\] of these crimes against us just as
God in Jesus has forgiven us -- completely and unconditionally," Moran
said directly to the suspect that day. "I want you to know that we
forgive you, without conditions, and that we love you. Our deepest
desire is for God's very best and greatest blessings for you. We also
know that sometimes we must go through difficult passages in this life
to receive God's best. We entrust those matters to the judicial system."
