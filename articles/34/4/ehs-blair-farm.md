EASTFORD --- It's hard to top Paul Blair's 30-plus acre farm on Route
171 in Eastford as a picture-perfect postcard example of a New England
farm. The property is one of the prettiest spots in Eastford. The farm
was purchased by Paul's immigrant grandparents in 1908 and operated as a
dairy farm for many years. Paul grew up there and has lived there most
of his life and has a great affection for the property.

A couple of years ago, the Eastford Conservation and Historic
Preservation Commission (ECHPC) mailed letters to many significant
property holders in Eastford to ask if they had an interest in
conserving their properties against future development by means of a
conservation easement. A conservation easement is a restriction placed
upon a property deed which restricts future development by any
subsequent purchaser. The ECHPC offered to help any interested landowner
search for funding and/or assist with a conservation effort in other
ways.

Paul answered the ECHPC letter, and together with the ECHPC sought out
funding for a conservation easement. Paul's property qualified for
potential funding under the State of Connecticut's Department of
Agriculture's Farmland Preservation Program. The ECHPC worked with Paul
to submit an application and helped him through the lengthy evaluation
process.

Fortunately, the property was selected by the state for farmland
conservation, and recently Paul was awarded some funding, in exchange
for which he placed qualifications on the property deed restricting the
larger share of the property to farming only activity in perpetuity.
Thus, the pretty farm property we all drive by on Route 171 will remain
picture postcard perfect into the long-term future and will continue to
mark Eastford as a quintessential New England town.
