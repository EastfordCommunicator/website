Thanksgiving is more than a date on the calendar, or a table filled with
food. It is a reminder of something deeply woven into the human heart,
namely the need to pause, to look upward, and to say "thank You" to the
One who provides every good thing.

True thanksgiving is about recognizing from whom our blessings come.
From the first pilgrims who gathered to thank God for His provision, to
families today who bow their heads before a meal, Thanksgiving has
always pointed us to a greater truth --- God is faithful. He sustains us
through hardship and fills our lives with countless daily mercies. As
the Psalmist declares, "It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing
praises to Your name, O Most High" (Psalm 92:1). Gratitude turns our
hearts from worry to worship and from busyness to blessing.

This year, Eastford Baptist Church invites you to celebrate that spirit
of gratitude with us. On Sunday, Nov. 23, we will gather for worship at
10:30 a.m., followed by a Thanksgiving Dinner where everyone is welcome.
It will be a joyful time of worship, fellowship, and reflection on the
goodness of God. After the service, we will share a hearty meal together
and take a few moments to express what we are thankful for. We will hear
stories of God's faithfulness, answered prayer, and quiet mercies that
remind us how near He truly is. Moments like these strengthen our sense
of community and renew our gratitude for the Lord's work in our lives.
Whether you have been part of Eastford for many years or are visiting
for the first time, we would be honored to have you join us. Come enjoy
a warm meal, good conversation, and the simple joy of giving thanks
together.
