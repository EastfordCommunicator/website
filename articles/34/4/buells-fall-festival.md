---

EASTFORD --- Buell's Orchard held its annual Harvest Festival on
Saturday, Oct. 11. The event, which was held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
included live music, hay rides, a chicken barbeque, apple and pumpkin
picking, ice cream by Buck's Soft Serve, face painting, and a special
appearance by Billy Steers, author of the "Tractor Mac" children's book
series. The event is usually held on Saturday and Monday (with limited
activities on Sunday), but due to inclement weather on Monday, Oct. 13,
the festival was limited to just Saturday.
