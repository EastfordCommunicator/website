Emergency Planning: Eastford recently took part in the annual
mandatory drill organized under the Governor's Emergency Planning and
Preparedness Initiative. This year's focus was on drought and the
increased risk of wildfires. Representing Eastford were James Roy
(Eastford Independent Fire Company), Ben Schmidt (Public Works), Bernard
Dubb (Communications), and Deb Richards (Emergency Management
Director/CEO). If you\'re interested in supporting Eastford Emergency
Management, please reach out to emd@townofeastford.com.

In addition, Eastford successfully completed the quarterly radio
communications test with CT DEMHS Region 4. Both of these activities are
essential components in maintaining eligibility for Emergency Management
Performance Grants.
