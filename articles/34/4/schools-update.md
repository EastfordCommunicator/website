Since the opening of the 2025-26 school year, our Board of Education
members have been busy meeting both as members of the full board and as
subcommittee members.

At the October meeting, the BOE members engaged in a discussion of our
latest results on the Connecticut Smarter Balanced Assessments (SBAC)
and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) facilitated by
Principal Carole McCombe. Each year, the EES staff analyze our spring
assessment results to look for trends, areas in need of growth, and to
celebrate our overall achievement. At all grade levels, the percentage
of students scoring at level 3 or 4 (at or above goal) on SBAC in
English Language Arts (ELA) increased for the same group of students
from the spring 2024 assessment to the spring 2025 assessment. Our math
results were not as promising. Here we saw that in all but our youngest
tested students, the percentage of students scoring at level 3 or 4 (at
or above goal) was smaller in 2025 than it was in 2024. Even still, it
is promising to note that at each grade level for ELA and for science,
our percentage of students scoring at goal or above is higher than the
state average, and in math, our percentage at goal or above, is higher
than the state average in all but two grade levels. [More complete
comparison data of the spring assessment results can be found at
eastfordct.org under the Curriculum/Assessment tab](https://www.eastfordct.org/curriculum/).

One of my personal highlights of the year so far has been working with
our "Super" Duper Math Problem Solvers. These are students in grades 1-3
who opt to complete, with their family, a math problem of the month that
I send home from October-May. I believe that interacting with our
students is one of the best ways to stay current, in a very small way,
with the challenges and rewards that our teachers experience each day.
This month I had the chance to discuss the October problem of the month
with 24 students in grades 1-3. It was wonderful to have each of them
share their work on the October problem with me.

Yes, the BOE together with the staff are busy supporting and
implementing programing that provides for an engaging and enriching
learning environment for all students at EES. Our efforts, however,
could not be accomplished without the ongoing support of our family and
community members. As always, please contact me at dleake@eastfordct.org
if you would like to meet to discuss any questions, concerns, or share
ideas about any aspect of the learning community of the Eastford School
District.
