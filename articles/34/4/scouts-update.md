title: Scouts Enjoy a Full Slate of Fall Activities
---

EASTFORD/ASHFORD --- Scouts recently enjoyed a day of bicycle riding on
the local Airline Trail in Hampton. The Airline Trail is an abandoned
railroad track that is now hard packed dirt pavement. Older Scouts
covered 24 miles, while the younger Scouts covered 12 miles or more.
There was one flat tire and no injuries.

Scouts had a bicycle competition in a "Slow Race." In a Slow Race, the
last person to cross the finish line is the winner! We may have more
bicycle rides in the future.

Cub Scouts of Pack 92 held their first pack meeting with a focus on fall
activities. They identified trees through leaf rubbings, made a pinecone
bird feeder, and played leaf tic-tac-toe. Cubs built superhero
scarecrows in front of the library along with the older Scouts to
decorate the Babcock Library for Halloween. Library Director Ann Harper
coordinated this activity. Photos of this will be in next month's
article.

Our November Cub Pack meeting will be a time to work on our citizenship
adventure and complete activities towards our community service project.

On Nov. 8, the Cubs will be scouting for food donations at the transfer
station. Please donate a non-perishable food item. We will have a tent
as you enter to collect items. All food donations will go to the food
pantry at Living Proof Church in Ashford.

On Nov. 7-9, Scouts campout at Wolf Den campground in Pomfret. A focus
will be on outdoor cooking, building pioneering camp gadgets, and going
for a hike.

Planning for a ski/snowboard trip in early January to Ski Sundown in New
Hartford and camp at Camp Workoeman there.

Scout meetings are the second and fourth Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. at St
Philip's Rec Center. New members are welcome.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! We are grateful for all that we have. Pray
for peace in the world.
