This is an alert to all of those concerned about their gardens,
orchards, forests, vines and ornamentals like roses.

There is a pest so dangerous that we are being told to kill it upon
seeing it. Actually, it is quite a beautiful insect. My husband and I
saw two of them in New Haven County last week. So, it is arriving in our
state now.

This insect is called the Spotted Lanternfly. See the accompanying photo
with this article or an image of it. It is not really a fly. They don't
munch on plant parts like beetles and caterpillars do. Instead, the
insects use a straw-like organ called a proboscis to pierce and then
suck plants' nutrient-rich juice.

Spotted Lanternflies can weaken the portions of the plant or tree where
the insects are feeding. The insects excrete honeydew that encourages
the growth of sooty mold. Sooty mold can interfere with photosynthesis
for the host plant and make it more vulnerable to disease.

What should you do if you spot a lanternfly? Trample it, says the
federal government and most states. If you find one, report it to the
State Department of Agriculture.

Although you can't discourage Spotted Lanternflies from coming to your
yard, a healthy, robust garden that doesn't rely on chemicals to be
robust should withstand feedings and attract predators that can help
with some of these insects. No insecticide is exclusive to the Spotted
Lanternfly and we don't want to hurt beneficial insect populations.

Please be on the lookout and help to eradicate these insects.
