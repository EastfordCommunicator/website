EASTFORD --- American Heart Association Instructor (AHA) Jeannine Spink
is pleased to announce that Eastford has been designated for another
three years as a "HEARTSafe Community." Eastford has earned this
designation since 2013 and was commended for having met the renewal
requirements of a designated HEARTsafe Community.

The Connecticut Department of Public Health's Office of Emergency
Medical Services and the AHA encourage and promote community awareness
of the potential for saving the lives of sudden cardiac arrest victims
through the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), increased public
access to defibrillation and advanced care.

HEARTSafe Community is a program designed to promote survival from
sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. It is a general concept focused
upon strengthening the "chain of survival" as described by the AHA. It
recognizes and stimulates efforts by individual communities to improve
their system for preventing sudden cardiac arrest from becoming
irreversible death.

A HEARTSafe Community promotes and supports CPR training in the
community; public access to defibrillation through strategic placement
of automated external defibrillators (AED's) for use by public safety
professionals and other trained community members.

The goal is simple --- if someone in our community suffers a sudden
cardiac arrest tomorrow, with proper training, survival may be based on
rapid access to life-saving treatment. With proper training, ordinary
citizens in our community can recognize the signs and symptoms of a
sudden cardiac or stroke event and know how to give care and get help
"on the way, right away."

So, when you enter the town boundaries of Eastford and notice the
HEARTSafe Community road signs, you can be assured that quick and
efficient care is as close to you as dialing "911" and be assured that
your friends and family and the Eastford Independent Fire Company #1 are
ready to do their part.
