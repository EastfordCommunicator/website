As we step into November, many of us roll into "holiday" mode, looking
forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations and traditions. For
me, Thanksgiving is a favorite as people have simple expectations, so
the stress of disappointing folks is minimal. In my house, if there are
ample provisions of mashed potatoes, stuffing and pie, all we be well.

The holiday season also brings people together -- which can be good news
and bad. There are those people we would rather not spend time with.
Maybe you remember "cousin Eddie" from those silly '80s "Vacation"
movies. And for many, there will be empty seats at the holiday table --
people and relationships we have lost. Add in all the expectations we
have for the holidays, and the stress can really amp up. The truth is
that for many people, the upcoming holiday season will be difficult --
painful even. I offer a few things -- some spiritual (to be talked about
in this article) and some practical (which you can find in this month's
Calendar section).

On the spiritual side, gratitude and the giving of thanks are so good
for the soul. Gratitude is an attitude of the heart. When we settle our
thoughts on the blessings we have, the empty places in our life are set
to the side. We are buoyed up. In the Scriptures, we are told to give
thanks both in all things and for all things.

Giving thanks is a bit different. It is an active thing. Thanks giving
is to say "thank you" to a person who has given you something. It is
relational. It connects us with the One who loves us. God loves you and
all good things come from Him. When we say "thank you, Lord" we
acknowledge His love and goodness toward us. There is much comfort in
knowing that God loves us, cares for us, is able to provide for us and
wants to do so. So, this Thanksgiving, thank Him out loud. You will be
glad you did.

Also on the spiritual side, if you are a Christian, I encourage you to
make much of Jesus this Christmas. Make Him the center of your
celebrations and the ruler of your expectations and commitments. What we
celebrate every Christmas is huge, profound and wonderful. And it is
really simple. As the Bible says, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among
us." God came to earth, born of a virgin in a humble stable. Jesus came!
And He gave His life for us that we might be forgiven all our sins and
live forever. Jesus makes all the difference. The Christmas message is
good news and oh so simple! So, I offer that we can choose simplicity
for our plans as we celebrate Christmas.

I will close with an invitation. The Lord loves you and wants you to
know Him. When Jesus was first connecting with the ones who would follow
Him, when they had questions about Him, He simply said "Come, and see."
So, I pass His invitation on to you. "Come and see." Join us for worship
in the Eastford Elementary School gym at 10 a.m. on Sundays. Or check
out Eastford Baptist at 10:30 a.m. Come meet Jesus.
