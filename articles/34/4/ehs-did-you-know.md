Did you know that the sinking of the RMS Lusitania, and two days later,
the USS Housatonic, causing the tragic loss of many American lives,
resulted in the United States entering World War I?

Provoked by Germany's unrestricted U Boat warfare on seagoing vessels,
President Wilson joined forces with the United Kingdom, and on April 6,
1917, after remaining neutral for three years, the United States
officially entered the "Great War."

On May 18, 1917, President Wilson signed into law the Selective Service
Act to fill the needs of the military to effectively engage the enemy.
Eastford answered the call sending forth 19 men to serve our country.
Most would see action overseas with only one man, Clarence Dews,
returning home with injuries.

At 5:40 a.m. on Nov. 11, with flare pistols shooting red, green, blue,
and white light into the sky and men cheering and yelling, the Armistice
was signed. All troops were ordered to cease firing at 11 a.m.

The Eastford Historical Society wishes to thank all military personnel,
past and present, for their service to our country.
