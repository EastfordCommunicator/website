Happy Autumn!

Does anyone know what the state flower of Connecticut is? Or what is the
Connecticut state bird? State tree? State fish? State insect? State
mammal? This November, when you're sitting around the Thanksgiving table
with family and friends, you can quiz each other about the state's cool
wildlife facts.

State Flower: Mountain Laurel (Kalmia latifolia); State Bird: American
robin (Turdus migratorius); State Tree: Charter Oak/White Oak (Quercus
alba); State Fish: American shad (Alosa sapidissima); State Insect:
European mantis (Mantis religiosa); State Mammal: Sperm Whale (Physeter
macrocephalus)

Notable and Notorious Guide, and you can find on their website here](https://thelastgreenvalley.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NandN.pdf).

Happy Thanksgiving!
