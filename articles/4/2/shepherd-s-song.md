One night while with my flocks I sat\
Watching over the sheep,\
I saw a sight while out that night\
When most lay fast asleep.

An angel of the Lord appeared\
With a fearsome light.\
The shepherds near me looked amazed\
For it was awfully bright.

"Fear not," he said, "I bring good news,\
Tidings of great joy.\
For in the town of Bethlehem\
Is born a little boy."

More appeared and began to sing,\
"Praise to God, on earth peace."\
They vanished, then we hurried off\
When their singing ceased.

We went to see the newborn King,\
Who in a manger lay;\
A star above His resting place\
Did guide and light the way.

This King of kings in human form\
To walk the humble earth,\
His Incarnation's hope to all\
In this child's birth.
