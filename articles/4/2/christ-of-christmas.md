Remember Christ of Christmas\
What do you do to remember\
When God does something great?\
Whether it's a job\
Or just the food you ate?

What do you do to remember\
When God does something kind?\
Erect a heap of stones,\
Your grandkids to remind?

What will you do to remember--\
As Christmas day draws nigh--\
There's more than just the lights\
Or all the gifts you buy?

There is---do you remember?---\
A brighter, purer light.\
Who came---you must remember!---\
Upon a clear midnight.

He was---will you remind them?---\
A sacrificial gift.\
Who came---you must remind them!---\
The inner veil to rip.

So how will you remember\
When <span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps">I am</span> wore the veil\
Of weakest human flesh?\
Rehearse the timeless tale.

Rebuild the old tradition\
Of walking through the past,\
For only Christ of Christmas\
Is sure to live and last.
