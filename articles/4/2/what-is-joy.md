Joy is a never-ending battle of life,\
A firm facet of the person you are,\
And the person you are becoming.\
It breaks down the Causes of strife.

Joy is living the life allotted you to the fullest,\
With full satisfaction of all you have been given.\
It is a flowering branch that blooms when doubt is released,\
And if cared for properly, will to eternity last.

Joy is a gift that has many dimensions\
Which can be so clear or easily stolen and hid.\
It may be as a song bursting forth or like oil trickling down\
Infusing a group with laughter and earnest anticipation.

Joy is a feeling almost indescribable\
That causes the heart to swell\
Or clench painfully with glorious anguish.\
This death-ending blessing is what broke Aslan\'s table.

Sweet is the joy that is newly found,\
Living, breathing, awe-inspiring essence.\
Joy is a brilliant strain that heals\
And every chapter of a fragmented story binds.

This hymn from creation sung\
To every one of God\'s children bestowed.\
Even to the farthest most darkest places\
To them also these beams of light are flung.

'Twas this response that was sung aloud by the angelic host so bright,\
This all-redeeming, triumphant, joyous praise and glorious love.\
That started first in heaven above and descended down to man\
On that first cold Christmas night.
