With jingles of bells and "Ho-ho's" of Santa\
And flights that must always delay in Atlanta,\
I wonder how Christmas could ever have been\
Silent night, peace on earth, with all good will to men.

We hustle and bustle to place after place,\
Our busyness draining the joy from our face.\
But, Shopper, take heart! And, Baker, rejoice!\
Don't even let carols drown out that Small Voice.

It whispers the reason for all of our mirth,\
The key to the myst'ry of true peace on earth.\
A Baby was born in a stable one night\
As Bethlehem slept, in spite of the Light.

He is the reason for "Good will to men."\
So say, "Merry Christmas!" again and again!\
And brighter than Christmas lights may your face glow.\
Jesus came; Jesus comes; Jesus loves, this I know.
