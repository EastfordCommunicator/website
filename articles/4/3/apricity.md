A dreary cold pervades my bones and chills\
Me to the core. I trudge along through snow\
And slush that blankets paths in icy hills.\
It seems to me, no matter where I go,\
I never shall be warm, nor ever thaw.\
Still I press on through highs and numbing lows;\
I pass a tree, and hear the raven's caw,\
A frozen stream wherein no water flows.\
And when I think that winter's cold will win,\
Conquering me like all that I have seen,\
And freezing me to that place where I stand.\
The sun appears, bright and promising life\
To creation transiently bound by winter's icy hand.\
I smile at the respite from this temporary strife.
