<p style="text-align: center;">
<!--this is supposed to look like a cross-->
A man of courage<br>
condemned to a cross<br>
A baby born<br>
in a trough bed in a barn<br>
Strapped up like a criminal<br>
and saturated with sin<br>
Denied by his followers whose faith fell through<br>
Tortured with a thorn-helm and tied to a tree<br>
He was destined to yield while his days dwindled<br>
This person so pure that for pawns had to perish<br>
Could've flown up to Heaven and be freed with a flourish<br>
A king, who through kindness, became like a kinsman<br>
Had humility too huge<br>
for the heart of a human<br>
A lamb whose slaughter<br>
looked like a loss<br>
But inside a lion-heart<br>
that loved without limits<br>
My Lord has left luxury<br>
for a thane like me<br>
I now yearn for nowhere<br>
but a place at his knee<br>
This Deity's destiny<br>
to have died for me<br>
is the imbedded meaning<br>
of my identity.
