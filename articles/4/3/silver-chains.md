Now who are you, that speaks of such strange dreams?\
What rave you, that more worlds exist than this?\
You talk of "shades," what is this "light" you mean?\
Escape from what? We dwell in perfect bliss.\
Leave off! It hurts! What is this that you do?\
You say we live in lies though silver-breath'd.\
Tis you who lies to us, you craven fool.\
Now leave us to our "chains in caverns deep."\
My eyes! My soul! My frame begins to fail.\
What is this horror that you've shown me here?\
I cannot look, my vision falters frail.\
And yet...now thrills my heart far more than fear.\
Oh light, oh Sun! How could I be so blind?\
I'll teach the world this treasure how to find.\
I canst go back. I am forever changed.
