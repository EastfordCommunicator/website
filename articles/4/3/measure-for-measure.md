## I.

O cipher fair and foul diagnostician\
Of those dark aspects e'er haunting my heart, \
I cannot now refuse your works of fission, \
Convalescing what you have torn apart---\
Apocalyptic Comedy! Blood flows\
Where rubies shone, and martyrdom is gone---\
What home is left? What cloistered orchard grows\
With measured fruit above a living lawn? \
Still unatoned, we moan as angels mock\
Our sighs---have we ever known otherwise? \
Should we forget the sand beneath the rock\
So long forgotten? Life begotten, dies. \
The devil's urine congregates in hell, \
And congeals there---when shall all things be well?

## II.

What devil bade the venal muse to sing?\
And in Vienna too. Study the soul, \
And lust and death shall drive out everything---\
One is not made a deacon by one's stole. \
Had Adam not been pricked by Cupid's sting, \
And had he not pricked Eve, born of his flesh, \
Would we be tangled in the spider's string, \
Or waiting for the flame to quit the thresh? \
What follows flame? The lasting howl of night, \
Some second womb birthing sequent decay, \
An unrepentant tempest e'er in flight, \
Or some more obscure fate unknown today?\
Our language lacks the word and lacks the hiss\
To signify the grange of our abyss. 

## III.

The conflagration and the flagellation\
Are in accord with the viewless design---\
The puppeteer's visible creation\
Is his Valentinian valentine. \
He walked the alleyways and spoke of death, \
Our liberation from this brutal life;\
He made us long for our loss of breath, \
To bid adieu, absolving bliss and strife. \
*To God!* He laughed. Sardonic irony \
Oozed from his mouth. *To God!* He spat, *To God!---*\
*O, if only they knew that I were he, *\
*That I drink absinthe e'er I wield my rod!*\
*To God!* He leaves, and silences the lapse,\
And pulls along us ladies and us chaps.

## IV.

Where is the bridegroom? Has he left the hall?\
The bride is waiting, blushing like a rose.\
The pears, the moated grange, the gable wall,\
And her brother's dying, dying bellows\
Are all the remnants of her dowry drowned.\
Her ring is calumny. Betrothal-fled,\
Alone she asks, "Where shall wisdom be found?"\
Solely among the regions of the dead.\
So she descended down and further down,\
She sank who could more easily have risen.\
A garland of black poppies was her crown---\
She was a queen in that umbrageous prison,\
And when she found her spouse on bended knee,\
Begging for death, she granted not his plea.

## V.

What light is this that makes one wish for dark?\
The scattered tenses of eternity,\
Of morning's nightingale and evening's lark,\
Exceed all music with their melody,\
And all their song is light. Light's variation,\
Betwixt the cipher and infinitude,\
May prove the endless substance of creation,\
Where wit may ransom will and will-not's feud.\
Yet quietus is worse. This other bride,\
What shall she say---is this her bridegroom true?\
Has blind Cupid so quickly grown quick-eyed,\
His golden dispensation to renew\
And dazzle doubly? Icons pass away---\
But shall the ravished votress answer yea?
