Dear Reader,

I am so excited to be bringing this issue of *Westmarch* to you! This issue is
themed around the Renaissance, which is one of my favorite periods of literature.
The Renaissance represents a time of exploration and questioning in literature. It was
a time of rediscovery and rebirth. Things old were integrated with things new–new
themes in old forms and old themes in new forms.

The Renaissance is a particularly apt theme for this issue since we have three
new ventures in this issue. First, this is the first issue of *Westmarch* that features
writing from students from colleges other than Patrick Henry College. In the true
spirit of the Renaissance, “Silver Chains,” a poem by Laura Hamilton from Grove
City College, combines the sonnet form with Plato’s allegory of the cave. Meanwhile,
Alexandra Frank’s poem, “Triumph of the death-tree,” uses concrete poetry to discuss
her identity in Christ. Lastly, Ginger Schiffmayer’s “Danse Macabre” presents a
realistic and heart-wrenching view of the Black Death.

This is also the first issue in which we will be publishing web exclusive
content along with the print journal. Check out the *Westmarch* website for my
favorite poetry of this issue, a set of five poems inspired by Shakespeare’s *Measure for
Measure* by Trinity Western University’s Bret van den Brink. You will also find two
criticism pieces dealing with *The Divine Comedy* and *The Faerie Queene*, as well as a
short story about a magic flautist. We hope you enjoy these pieces as much as we do.
Lastly, since part of the goal of *Westmarch* is to embrace art and beauty in
all forms, we have partnered with the PHC Art Society in order to feature student
artwork throughout this issue. We are so excited by how this issue has come together,
and we hope you will see all the beauty in it that we do.
As we remember the Renaissance, may we embrace curiosity. May we all
continue to inquire and explore throughout the semester and throughout the rest of
our lives.
