The whole canon of English literature is the story of poets,
playwrights, and authors building upon the inheritance they have
received. None have done it so well as John Milton. Following in the
wake of Edmund Spenser's literary legacy, Milton embraces the classical
heritage of the Greeks while bringing a modern aspect to them. Milton
himself calls Spenser a better teacher than Aquinas, turning to Spenser
for his Platonic worldview as well as his marriage of classical virtues
with Christian Renaissance virtues. Milton's *Paradise Lost* and masque
play, *Comus*, are the best and brightest examples of the influence
Spenser had on the young poet. Through these two works Spenser's
influence is clear, though often hidden underneath the surface--a
classic technique Spenser liked to employ. His influence enlightens the
words of Milton to bring together a whole new dynamic of meaning and
dimension that would have otherwise been left untapped.

Though implicit, the connection between *Paradise Lost* and *The Faerie
Queene* emphasizes not only how much Spenser influenced Milton\'s style,
but also how crucial Spenser's work was in the creation of *Paradise
Lost* itself*.* The first of these connections is the theme of
temperance. Milton's epic poem pursues a plotline directed by the virtue
of temperance. To understand why temperance is so pivotal in this epic,
one must first understand Spenser's conceptualization of it. Spenser was
a student of Plato and based his understanding of temperance on the
tripartite soul, where reason rules over the spiritual and appetitive
parts (Greenlaw 202). Since temperance was the quintessential virtue of
the Renaissance, Spenser draws from this and points his readers back to
the Platonic tripartite. In other words, a balanced soul exhibits
temperance. Throughout *The Faerie Queene,* Spenser connects the
pitfalls and ill-chosen paths to intemperance. In Book I, Redcrosse
falls into the trap set by the witch Duessa to lead him away from Una.
Spenser describes the moment in highly Platonic terms:

\[Redcrosse\] burnt with gealous fire,

> *The eye of reason was with rage yblent*,\
> And would have slaine them in his furious ire,\
> But hardly was restreinèd of that aged sire. (Spenser 1.2.5.6-9, my
> emphasis)

Here Spenser points out that it is a lack of temperance, the
overpowering of the rational part of the soul by the spirited part, that
causes Redcrosse to fall. Una then takes Redcrosse to the house of
Caelia where he is described as a "soule-diseasèd knight" (Spenser
1.10.24.1). Redcrosse must learn to balance his soul before he can
pursue his quest of holiness. Caelia becomes Redcrosse's instructor and
calls him "with straight diet \[to\] tame his stubborne malady" for the
purpose of controlling his "proud humors" (Spenser 1.10.25.9-26.2).
Redcrosse is disciplined by Penance and pricked by Remorse while
Repentance heals the wounds which they inflict until "in short space
they did to health restore / The man that would not live, but earst lay
at deathes dore" (Spenser 1.10.27). In other words, the imbalance of his
soul affects his well-being, and only through proper penance can he
restore the original order.[^1] Milton picks up on this theme, using it
to fully flesh out the immediate consequences of the Fall in *Paradise
Lost.*

In Book II of *The Faerie Queene*, the knight Guyon is actively pursuing
a life of temperance. The first test Guyon must pass centers around the
*Bowre of blis*. Despite being affected by the beauty of the place,
Guyon "suffred no delight / to sincke into his *sence*, nor *mind
affect*, ... Bridling his *will*, and *maistering his might*" (Spenser
2.12.53.2-5). These lines employ Platonic language, praising Guyon for
allowing reason ("might") to dominate the appetitive ("sence") and
spiritual ("mind") parts of his soul. The second test is highly
reminiscent of the episode in Genesis 3, influencing Milton's own
description of the Fall. Unlike Redcrosse and later Milton's Adam, Guyon
passes the test (see Spenser 3.12.56-57). When the lovely woman offers
him a cup of wine, Guyon "yet withstond" and "nought regarding her
displeasure forward goth" (Spenser 3.12.57.7,10).

Milton follows Spenser's lead and centers the entire plot of *Paradise
Lost* around temperance. He overtly claims that intemperance is the
cause of the Fall, relying on the Platonic form of temperance embodied
in *The Faerie Queene.* In his work *Areopagitica,* Milton points out
the importance of temperance as Spenser's central theme:

> That virtue therefore which is but a youngling in the contemplation of
> evil, and knows not the utmost that vice promises to her followers,
> and rejects it, is but a blank virtue, not a pure; ... which was the
> reason why our sage and serious poet Spenser (whom I dare be known to
> think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas), describing true
> *temperance* under the person of Guyon, brings him in which his Palmer
> through the Cave of Mammon and the Bower of Earthly Bliss, that he
> might see and know, and yet *abstain* (*Areopagitica* 1931, my
> emphasis).

By weaving temperance into the fabric of *Paradise Lost,* Milton
expounds upon his praise of Spenser and his sage Platonian concept of a
balanced soul. Milton also imitates Spenser by describing all the events
surrounding the Fall in terms of intemperance. He calls the Tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil "the tree / Of prohibition" as a
foreshadowing of the test which Adam and Eve will soon fail (*Paradise
Lost,* 10.644-645).[^2] When Eve takes the fruit, Milton describes how
"her rash hand in evil hour" brought grief upon the earth (*PL*
10.780-782). The angel Michael calls her disobedience "th' inabstinence
of Eve" (*PL* 10.476) Thus the Fall is not soley described in terms of
their disobedience, but in Adam and Eve's ability to control their
desires and emotions through reason. Viewing the Fall in terms of the
Spenserian dichotomy, the impact of Eve's simple act of disobedience
suddenly becomes apparent. Not only does her decision throw her own soul
into perpetual inner war, but all of creation as well (see *PL*
9.782-784). Milton also ridicules Adam in the name of intemperance.
Because he allows his love for Eve to cloud his judgement, the Son
reprimands him saying, "Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey? ...
adorned / She was indeed, and lovely to attract" (*PL* 10.145).[^3]

However, the theme of temperance is not the only thing which Milton
imitates. Through construction of the plot, Milton borrows heavily from
Spenser. An example of this is in Book I of *The Faerie Queene.*
Spenser's plot structure is as follows: Redcrosse is lead astray by
Duessa, saved by Una from his attempted suicide, saved by Arthur, and
purified by Caelia (Greenlaw 214). Milton follows a similar plot
structure (Greenlaw 216). After Eve gives him the forbidden fruit, Adam
attempts to commit suicide. Eve, however, saves him and encourages him
to pray for forgiveness. Just like Redcrosse, the couple is instructed
on how to live a holy life by the angel Michael.

If Milton is a true disciple of Spenser, one would expect that after
this, Adam, fully ready to pursue a holy life, "would have met the
dragon Satan, as Redcrosse met him, and conquered" (Greenlaw 216).
However, because he chooses to follow the Genesis account of the Fall,
Milton deviates from a strict imitation of Spenser, though he still pays
homage to Spenser in other ways. Milton does not turn completely away
from his sage and serious teacher but instead follows his own
inclination regarding myth. Unlike Spenser who sees the allegorical
value of the myths, using their beauty and mystery to paint a picture of
the Christian life, Milton uses the myths as a framework to propel the
plot forward (Collett 93). Instead of elaborating on the Genesis
account, Milton chooses to borrow the same mythical tropes that Spenser
employed. In *Paradise Lost,* Adam morphs into an Everyman character who
steps aside as Christ conquers the dragon in the style of an Arthurian
legend (Greenlaw 216). The Son, after defeating Satan, is described
thus: "Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend / With victory,
triumphing through the air / ... Then enter into glory, and resume / His
seat at God's right hand" (*PL* 12.451-453, 456-457). In a similar way,
Redcrosse returns to the Faerie Queene after defeating the dragon: "Yet
swimming in that sea of blisfull joy, / He hought forgot, how he whilome
had sworne, / In case he could that monstrous beast destroy, / Unto his
Faerie Queene backe to returne: / The which he shortly did, and Una left
to mourne" (Spenser 1.12.41.5-9). Milton, then, uses the mythological
structure of *The Faerie Queene* to create a biblically accurate plot,
without giving up the Spenserian epic style.

Milton also uses Spenser's work to fashion the character of Eve. He
combines the characters of Una and Duessa to create his heroine, just as
he bases his Adam on Redcrosse (Bond 81). There are also similarities
between Milton's Eve and Acrasia from Book III of *The Faerie Queene*.
The most important differentiation between Milton's Eve and the ladies
of Spenser's epic is that Eve is human -- that is to say, not of fairy
genealogy. While at the beginning Eve is perfect, pure, and a sure
guide, like Una is to Redcrosse, Satan's temptation turns her
temporarily into Duessa and Acrasia (*PL* 9.886-887). Eve transforms
into an enchantress, calling Adam "to complete the 'glorious trial of
exceeding love' by sharing her fate" (Bond 82). Adam is "fondly overcome
with female charms" and chooses to take part in his wife's folly (*PL*
9.999). A similar scene is described by Una "In which \[Redcrosse\]
chauncèd false Duessa meete / Mine onley foe, mine onely deadly dread /
Who with her witchcraft and missemeing sweete, / Inveigled him to follow
her desires unmeete" (*FQ* 1.7.50.6-9). Thus Eve seduces Adam into
disobedience just as Redcrosse falls for Duessa's tricks.

Despite being the one to lead Adam into temptation, Eve also serves as
his mediatrix, just as Una serves as Redcrosse's mediatrix when saving
him from suicide (Bond 82). In Book I of *The Faerie Queene,* Redcrosse
is faced with the reality that he must stand before God's judgment seat:

> The sight whereof so thoroughly him dismaid,\
> *That nought but death before his eyes he saw*,\
> And ever burning wrath before him laid,\
> By righteous sentence of th'Almighties law:\
> ...\
> \[Trevisan\] bad him choose, what death he would desire:\
> For death was due to him, that had provokt Gods ire.\
> ...
>
> He to him *raught a dagger sharpe and keene*,\
> ... and trouble bloud through his pale face was seene\
> To come, and goe with tydings from the hart,\
> ...\
> At last resolved to worke his final smart,\
> He lifted up his hand, that backe againe did start. (*FQ* 1.9.50-51,
> my emphasis)

Redcrosse desires to take his own life to escape living under God's
wrath. Adam's lament after the Son pronounces the coming judgement is
remarkably similar to Redcrosse's. He sees death as a refuge from God's
wrath, and wishes it to come quickly:

> Thy punishment then justly is at his will.\
> Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,\
> That dust I am, and shall to dust return:\
> *O welcome hour whenever!* why delays

His hand to execute his decree

> Fixed on this day? *Why do I overlive,\
> Why am I mocked with death,* and lengthened out

To deathless pain?

...

Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground, and oft

Cursed his creation, Death as oft accused

Of tardy execution, since denounced

The day of his offence. Why comes not Death?

Said he, *with one thrice ácceptáble stroke*

*To end me? (PL* 10.768-775, 851-856, my emphasis)

Both Redcrosse and Adam immediately wish to remove themselves from the
trial and look to death as their rescue. The one important difference
between these accounts is that while Redcrosse simply tries to commit
suicide, Milton's Adam recognizes God as the giver of life and instead
prays for death to come swiftly.

Of course, death is not the answer, and it is through the mouths of the
heroines -- Eve and Una -- that they are each saved from their
death-wish. Through their words, the two women help the heroes to recall
and appeal to the redemptive grace of God. Just as Spenser calls upon
Una to save Redcrosse, so too does Milton use Eve as the means of
salvation for Adam. But in order for these heroines to save the heroes,
they must first learn a lesson of their own: "As Arthur saves Una from
despair, ... so the Son's appearance in the garden provides Eve with the
example of love and compassion that allows her to rescue Adam" (Bond
113). The role of the heroines is best described by Milton scholar Dr.
Christopher Bond:

> This complexity -- and in particular the centrality of a female
> character to the salvation of the secondary hero, ... appealed to
> Milton. *The Faerie Queene* accordingly provided him with a model for
> the redemption of Adam in *Paradise Lost,* a process in which the Son
> and Eve play a vital roles that correspond to those played by Arthur
> and Una in the salvation of the Knight of Holiness. (Bond 104)

Bolstered by Arthur's encouragement to "be of cheare, and comfort to you
take: for till I have acquit you captive knight, / Assure your selfe, I
will your not forsake," Una has the courage to save Redcrosse from
suicide (*FQ* 1.7.52.5-7; 1.10.52-53). In the same way, Eve "approaching
nigh, / Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed" (*PL* 10.864-865).
She then reminds Adam that God "will instruct us praying, and of grace /
Beseeching him, so as we need not fear / To pass commodiously this life,
sustained / By him with many comforts, till we end / In dust, our final
and native home" (*PL* 10.1081-1085).

Milton also imitates Spenser in *Comus,* which C.S. Lewis described as
"'a play written on an episode from *The Faerie Queene,* all magic and
distressed ladies\[,\] and haunted woods'" (*Reading* 93). Overall,
*Comus* is more mystical and fantastical than *Paradise Lost*, which
immediately brings Spenser to mind. The play is filled with a plethora
of references to Greek mythology. The mystic setting begins with the
introduction of the attendant Spirit who gives the historical background
of Comus. Comus, the antagonist, is the son of Bacchus and Circe of
Greek legend, who "Excels his Mother at her mighty Art, / Off'ring to
every weary Traveller / His orient liquor in a Crystal Glass" which
turns any human into some form of beast (*Comus* lines 90-98). While
this is almost direct quotation of the *Odyssey,* one can also find a
very similar incident in *The Faerie Queene.* Acrasia, an enchantress,
has a special wine with which she "Does charme her louers, and the
feeble sprightes / Can call out of the bodies of fraile wightes: / Whom
then she does transform to monstrous hewes, / And horribly misshapes
with vgly sightes" (Spenser 2.5.27.4-7). Spenser's Acrasia imitates
Homer's Circe and lives on an island. The land in which she dwells is
described as "stray in perilous gulfe, her dwelling is; / Faire Sir, if
euer there ye trauell, shonne / The cursed land were many wend amis, /
And know it by the name; it hight the *Bowre of blis*" (Spenser
2.1.51.5-9). Milton also describes Comus' residence in terms of a bowre:
"At last betakes him to this ominous Wood, / And in thick shelter of
black shades imbow'r'd" (*Comus* lines 61-62). Just as Acrasia seduces
her pray from a bowre, so too does Comus.

Milton also follows Spenser's structure with the attempted seduction of
the Lady. Like Una, she is not mortal. Comus, upon hearing her awaken
the nymph Echo, remarks about her singing, saying, "Can any mortal
mixture of Earth's mold / Breathe such Divine enchanting ravishment? /
Sure something holy lodges in that breast" (*Comus* lines 244-246). He
finds her alone, having been left behind by her two brothers. This is
very similar to *The Faerie Queene* when Una is discovered by Sansloy
who,

> With beastly sin thought her to have defiled,
>
> And made the vassal of his plasures vilde.
>
> Yet first he cast by treatie, and by traynes,
>
> Here to perswade, that stubborne fort to yilde:
>
> For greater conquest of hard love he gaynes,
>
> That works it to his will, then he that it constraines. (Spenser
> 1.6.3-9)

When Una refuses to surrender her chastity, Sansloy tries to force her.
When she calls out for help, a group of Faunes and Satyres come to her
aide (Spenser 1.6.8.6-9).

Milton follows this same plot structure when Comus tries to seduce the
Lady. When the Lady willingly follows Comus, she is brought to his
palace as a prisoner. He offers her his enchanted cup, which she
refuses. Comus tries to win her virginity through charms, enjoining her
to "be not coy, and be not cozen'd / With that same vaunted name
Virginity; Beauty is nature's coin, must not be hoarded" (*Comus* lines
737-739). The Lady holds up against his rhetoric, despite Comus'
injunction to "Be wise, and taste" (*Comus* line 813). Her brothers'
rescue of her, breaking the Glass into pieces, is reminiscent of of
Guyon's resistance of Acrasia's offering of another cup: "So she to
Guyon offred it to tast; / Who taking it out of her tender hond, / The
cup to ground did violently cast, / That all in peeces it was broken
fond" (Spenser 3.12.57.14).

Just as the Faunes and Satyres come to Una's rescue, the sea nymph
Sabrina and her water-Nymphs rescue the Lady.[^4] The mystic creature
saves the Lady by applying drops from her fountain "on \[her\] breast
... Thrice upon \[her\] finger's tip, / Thrice upon \[her\] rubied lip;
/ Next this marble venom'd seat / Smear'd with gums of glutinous heat /
I touch with chaste palms moist and cold. / Now the spell has lost his
hold" (*Comus* lines 911, 914-920). What is most surprising, but also
rather Spenserian, is how a woman saves the Lady. This is consistent
with Spenser's use of women to save the primary hero. In this way,
Sabrina is like Una, a pure, chaste woman who fights for the virtue of
those underneath the spell of a malignant sorcerer. Ultimately, she
morphs into a female Arthurian figure like Redcrosse in *The Faerie
Queene* (Greenlaw 216). It is because of her training in holiness (and
her self-sacrifice) that she is able to save the Lady, just as Redcrosse
is able to save Una and her parents from the dragon after learning from
Caelia.

Reading Milton without knowing Spenser is like reading Virgil without
knowing Homer. They must be read in conjunction. To understand the
significance of the theme and composition of *Paradise Lost,* one must
understand Spenser's design in *The Faerie Queene.* In the same way, the
characters become more dimensional as one explores the literary context
and inheritance which Adam and Eve carry with them. Through temperance,
the Fall is no longer a grave act of disobedience, but the undermining
of the God-balanced soul and universe. To fully understand *Comus,* one
must find all the hidden appearances Spenser makes, bringing another
dimension of meaning and significance. Without Spenser, Milton's poem
and masque are great; with Spenser, they are magnificent.
