I laid my head upon the ground to sleep\
And fell into a dream one Winter's night.\
I woke amidst a wood so dark and deep\
My eyes could scare perceive for lack of light.\
But then I heard the ring of bells in flight.\
Below the glow of frigid flame I saw\
The Winter Queen enrobed in awful white,\
Her face so fair that none could find a flaw.

I felt my heart at once begin to leap\
And dread desire was then inmixed with fright.\
I fell before the Queen who seemed to weep;\
Her frozen tears did form a mask of white.\
But hard and cold with eyes no longer bright,\
As if no man her heart could hope to thaw,\
The Winter Queen enthroned it seemed a wight\
Her face so fair that none could find a flaw.

I felt her thrall upon my mind to creep\
And wished no more to flee the coming plight.\
She swept along, intent my soul to reap,\
Her slender hands outstretched with strength to smite.\
But then I heard the call of songs so bright.\
Above the blaze of blinding light I saw\
The Winter Queen enraged had turned to flight,\
Her face so fair that none could find a flaw

Beyond the wood my soul awoke to sight,\
But in the blaze I glimpsed with holy awe\
The Paschal Maid endued with grace and might,\
Her face so fair that none could find a flaw
