The small stream tumbles over smoothed pebbles, creating a light, bubbly sound in an otherwise dead silent forest. A crunch of autumnal leaves, the crackle of a figure breaking through dead twigs, and Edwin emerges into the chilly clearing, picking bits of detritus out of his ochre hair. Spotting his quarry, he sits down beside her with a quiet exhale, careful not to startle the solitary forest-dweller. Eve doesn’t bother to look up.

After letting the stream babble its song, perhaps longer than necessary, he breaks the silence. 

“You’re not human.”

She takes a long time to respond, deep in concentration, as she works with a needle and thread. Up and down, a silver needle piercing flesh like a scalpel, yellowed thread connecting a dead hand back to a once dead arm in a practiced ritual.
“Not exactly.”

He lets her answer hang in the air, the hoarse acknowledgment confirming the obvious. Shiny pitch hair hides her face from view, but he can still picture it well: the stretched, translucent flesh warped by surgical scars, the electric blue veins and visibly pulsing arteries, the dun eyes frozen wide at the shrieks of his peers. 

The starched collar of his boarding school uniform itches his neck as his hands fiddle with her dropped scarf. The soft garment that formerly hid her face from the world is as patchworked as her skin.

Her voice suddenly breaks the silence again, hurried, anxious: “You see, my creator, er, I guess he’s my father, really-”
“You don’t need to explain. It’s alright.”

She finally turns to look at him, red-rimmed eyes searching chestnut brown ones with the vulnerability of an exposed nerve. Whatever she finds there causes her blackened lips to curl into a smile, brightening her face like a lightning strike.

Silence settles over the clearing once again, but this time, their mutual warmth keeps out the chill of the howling wind.
