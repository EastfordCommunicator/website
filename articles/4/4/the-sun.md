you are the sun.\
not the one in the middle of summer that makes for hot days, and\
blazes so bright that i have to squint.\
rather, you are the one that shines in the dead of winter\
amongst the dreary eternity\
of barren trees and monotonous gray clouds,\
the sun that thaws my soul\
and seeps deep into my frozen bones, that pulls me into its rays\
and brings me back to life.
