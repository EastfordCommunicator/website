## Exposition: "The Romantic *Cogito*"

The clocktower's carillon bells pealed a euphonious tune---a boon to the
*Cogito's* ears. The time was twelve o'clock *post meridiem*. The
*Cogito*, presently a matriculant, now took its quotidian, post-prandial
stroll along the campus's quad. There was not a soul in sight.
Consequently, the *Cogito* gave itself over to romantic cognition:

"I, the Cartesian *I-think*, hath been *loosed* once more, though
temporarily of course---cry a tear for the death of instinct, why don't
you, Rousseau---from the lugubrious, shifty strictures of *nomos*, to
roam free, volitionally, under the aegis of immutable *physis*!

In celebration of these natural beauties before me, I shall pen an
encomium immediately! For what sublimity! What beauty!"

Yet, as the *Cogito* tried to fix its mind on the imminent encomium, a
torrent of Trofimovian factoids did becloud its brain:

"Should I not first append to the encomium, as an analect, the famous
anecdote about Thales---who, too, like Kant, seemed to be drawn to
natural beauty and sublimity? It is said that he, Thales, the first
Pre-Socratic, bewitched by the firmament's aesthetics whilst walking,
fell into a well!"

"Maybe not," the *Cogito* resolved, "for today, the sun's too bright
(*fiat lux*). Plato's liberated cave-dweller is, after all, a mere
figment of allegory. Human sight will never adjust to the *sun
itself*---it is too much for us---a *saturated phenomenon*! But now I'm
just raving like Gayev. Let me return to the task at hand."

The *Cogito* snapped itself out of the abstract digression, resolving to
contemplate the more supra-sensible, non-cognitive matter at hand. It
sat itself on a bench, pulled out a lurid moleskin, and commenced to pen
an "Encomium of Natural Sublimity and Beauty" (from the perspective of
Kantian Aesthetics[^1]).

## "Encomium of Mathematical Sublimity"

Oh, mathematical sublimity! Oh, cursed mathematical sublimity! You are
so painful and hostile, yet so necessary. For you, mathematical
sublimity, are a means of contrast: "Nothing is harder to bear than a
succession of fair days."

You are a momentary inhibition of the vital forces---the proverbial
turtle hiding its neck. You are the aporetic mystery of a Nature divided
against itself---Manichaeism.

Hence mathematical sublimity is: The pulchritudinous, precocious blooms
of an early spring, delicate though they are, have to withstand the
unkind jostlings of malevolent, alacritous winds; the vast firmament,
nimbiferous with caliginosity, calling into question all religiosity.

Analogically, mathematical sublimity is the reality of sickness and
mortality. Mathematically sublime is the crucifixion of Christ.

For the moment, mathematical sublimity makes one feel *diminished,
insignificant*.

For the Christian, mathematical sublimity puts *faith* to the test. For
the *problem of natural* evil is mathematically sublime. Primo Levi's
*Survival in Auschwitz* is mathematically sublime.

## "Encomium of Dynamical Sublimity"

Oh, dynamical sublimity! Oh, blessed dynamical sublimity! Your feeling
produces courage in the face of catastrophe.

You are a violent bursting forth of vital forces. You are Aristotelian
*catharsis*.

Hence is dynamical sublimity: The pulchritudinous, precocious blooms
defying, with regal obstinacy, even in their delicate state, the
malevolent, alacritous, jostling winds---a sign of hope.

Analogically, you are the immune system conquering infection. You are
Christ's resurrection.

For the moment, one has reason to view themselves no longer as
insignificant but, rather, as an *Imago Dei*, possessive of an
inviolable, everlasting soul.

For the Christian, dynamical sublimity is the feeling of Kierkegaard's
faith-leap*.*

Kant's ideas of pure and practical reason are dynamically sublime.

Jesus's Kingdom of God is dynamically sublime.

## "Encomium on Beauty"

Oh, Beauty! Holy, pleasant beauty! You are the triumph of the dynamical
over the mathematical.

You manifest as a freewheeling dance between the Kantian faculties of
imagination and understanding. And you are romantically non-cognitive:
your pleasure is felt *immediately*, qua *feeling*! Thus, you are a
product of the heart, not the mind.

Hence is beautiful: The Good; the realization of Kant's Kingdom of Ends;
the realization of Jesus's Kingdom of God.

Hence is analogical beauty: Tranquil zephyrs licking one's skin; a
scintillation before the eyes of salubrious foliage; intertwining
networks of twigs striving toward their Aristotelian entelechy; the
gentle smile of a passerby; the azure firmament; the glory of God's
variegated promise after a storm; pareidolia: a beneficent,
purposive-without-a-purpose countenance in the clouds; the invigorating,
fragrant odours of spring; the chirping of chicks; the dancing of birds;
their tripudiation; their rapid nictations; their regal pretense; their
games and mating rituals.

For the moment, our minds are in a state of aesthetical bliss as we
wonder at the teleology of nature.

*finis*

[^1]: Cf. Kant's *The Critique of the Power of Judgment* (1790). This
    work is arguably a major touchstone for romantics, given its
    conception of beauty as 'non-cognitive'. Kantian Aesthetics
    recognizes three distinct, yet interrelated aesthetic feelings: a)
    mathematical sublimity, b) dynamical sublimity, and c) beauty.
