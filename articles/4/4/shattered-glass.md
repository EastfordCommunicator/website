Shattered Glass\
Fractals reflecting into\
refractions;\
shards splitting human shadows\
into contorted compositions 

Kneeling over the lake's crystal\
mesmerized\
by aquatic abyss; darkness\
breaks body, splinters soul 

Limbs duplicate disordered and disjointed as\
thoughts---  

Shadows worship the setting sun\
adding harmonic hallucinations as they stretch\
arms\
raised in homage to their maker 
 

Turquoise fades, waves whither---hues\
mutilate;\
a concerto of crimson, vermilion variations,\
blues burned away by phantom flames,\
Violated remains of human visage\
dissipate\
scalding waters stained with ink\
as nightmares\
drown in ebony 




Snowdrop Awakening

Dewdrop clings

to the pine needle's edge,

clear crystal grasping the outstretched

verdant blade

as it hangs, precarious

over the precipice...

Blind to the stony landing site,

senses drown in the battering of alpine breezes;

helpless molecules of chilled opalescence

beg to stay grounded.

Forced to succumb, the dewdrop fails,

plummeting through frosted air, waiting

to dash on permafrost below---

only to land on a bed of snow-capped silk.

Petals just beginning to

break open

breathe shades of ivory and blush, catching

the droplet as it reflects a kaleidoscope of

blue frost, green needle,

and the pale yellow of a chilled sun

just starting to thaw.

Now it reflects what

grounds it---

cotton white and the pinks of dawn,

the brown of silt barely warm enough

to support the stem

of a shy snowdrop, only just

awakened.
