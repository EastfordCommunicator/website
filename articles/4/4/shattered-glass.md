Shattered Glass\
Fractals reflecting into\
refractions;\
shards splitting human shadows\
into contorted compositions 

Kneeling over the lake's crystal\
mesmerized\
by aquatic abyss; darkness\
breaks body, splinters soul 

Limbs duplicate disordered and disjointed as\
thoughts---  

Shadows worship the setting sun\
adding harmonic hallucinations as they stretch\
arms\
raised in homage to their maker 
 

Turquoise fades, waves whither---hues\
mutilate;\
a concerto of crimson, vermilion variations,\
blues burned away by phantom flames,\
Violated remains of human visage\
dissipate\
scalding waters stained with ink\
as nightmares\
drown in ebony
