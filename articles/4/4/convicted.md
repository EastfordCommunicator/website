*Out of the night that covers me,*\
*Black as the pit from pole to pole,*\
I am called just before the dawn,\
and yet the dawn remains shrouded below.

*I thank whatever gods may be*\
*For my unconquerable soul.*\
How to thank the God that made me\
for an easily subdued soul?

*In the fell clutch of circumstance*\
*I have not winced nor cried aloud.*\
I screamed and sobbed excruciating tears\
under the pain of heart's desire and worldly wares.

*Under the bludgeonings of chance*\
*My head is bloody, but unbowed.*\
Chance was cast back to wind's rumor,\
my brow bows beneath invisible tyrants,\
smiling at my wounds and weeping.

*Beyond this place of wrath and tears*\
*Looms but the Horror of the shade,*\
beneath my bowing brow,\
it smells of iron and defeat,

*And yet the menace of the years*\
*Finds and shall find me unafraid.*\
crippled by anxiety's weight, forces unafraid to taunt,\
burdened by an undoing of my own making.

*It matters not how strait the gate,*\
*How charged with punishments the scroll,*\
but I thank Him that made me\
that I do not face the storms alone.

*I am the master of my fate,*\
*I am the captain of my soul.*\
I am NOT the master of my fate,\
I am NOT the captain of my soul.
