I've counted 63 dragonflies\
in the past 24-hours.\
That's 252 wings.\
Little angels in the sky\
glittering golden yellow,\
bright red,\
transparent blue,\
and spotty brown,\
turning my world technicolor;\
a million hums in my ears,\
a symphony of symbolisms,\
heartbeats of hope,\
and new beginnings.\
