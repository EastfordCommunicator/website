Night's Lament\
Mountains red in dying day,\
Petals dancing in the breeze,\
Flowers tied in close bouquets.
Peace, daughter, whisper the trees.

Rock drags beneath a finger,\
Cave walls glow by magic light,\
Tears and broken sobs linger.\
Hush now, daughter, murmurs night.

Darkness brushes everything,\
Stars across the sky rotate,\
Gently, with soft light, they ring\
the sphere---peace, daughter, they state.

Water upon endless sand\
Ebb and flow of leaving tide.\
Hush now, daughter, waves command,\
Cry unheard in our provide.

To mountain peak she stumbles\
Falling, crying---shaking hands.\
Peace, daughter, mountain rumbles.\
With a sob and shove, she stands.

Down the mountain, over beach\
She runs beneath shining stars,\
Past cave, wood, and calls of each,\
Runs from memories and scars.

At river, she runs no more.\
Tired legs buckle, give out.\
There she pleads with heaven's door,\
Voice raises to desperate shout.

*Give him back to me*, she cries\
To the night that's silent, deep.\
Yet, she knows that he won't rise\
From his gentle, final sleep.

Bitter tears trail down her face\
Ripple in the calm water\
As her sobbing slows its pace.\
Silence calls, rest now, daughter.

Soft grass brushes, under palm\
Stars fade, falling from their crown.\
Mountain stills and waves are calm,\
The trees quiet, winds die down.

*Peace*, she whispers, *keep your course.*\
Memories come one by one\
Singing, nature resumes force\
Beneath rays of rising sun.
