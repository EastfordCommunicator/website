All was light,\
Bright,\
And warm,\
On those early autumn days.\
The sun rested on our faces,\
And the wind tossed the leaves off the trees.\
Youthful days,\
Shaped and shadowed\
By red and purple leaves,\
Rent from the trees.\
We laughed and chased each other,\
On pathways washed in violent,\
Golden sunlight,\
Straight out of Gauguin.\
As the last light of day stretched itself over our bodies----\
Like the cream and camel sweaters we wore----\
You stood against the light of the sun,\
And the rays burned your hair into a halo of swirling light.\
I will always remember those happy times,\
In the fall,\
Full of light\
Full of warmth\
And mirth\
And joy\
Inexplicable.\
Perhaps the closest we get to heaven on earth\
Is when we see those we love\
Washed in autumnal sunlight,\
Laughing.\
With their backs against the sky,\
And our faces to the wind.
