Dear Reader,

Our theme for this issue of *Westmarch* is "All Saints and Angels." This issue comes out on All Saints' Day, a feat day that honors all saints, whether known or unknown. As such, we sought to explore what it means to be a saint in this issue. Sainthood is a vocation that we, as Christians, are all called to. We are called to live our lives open to God and His plan for us. Dr. Veith highlights this in [his criticism piece on George Herbert and vocation.](/4/1/brittle-crazy-glass/) As we, like Herbert, struggle to discover our own vocations, we would do well to remember our primary calling--that of becoming a saint. 

Yet, this calling manifests itself differently in all of us. For St. Paul, this vocation involves suffering and earthly chains, as Emma Sawyer so beautifully demonstrates [in her poem](/4/1/in-honor-of-paul/). [In Eden Westrate's poem](/4/1/a-musing-on-the-pear-tree/), sainthood manifests itself quite simply: through God's mercy and grace. [Meanwhile, Hannah Fear's criticism piece](/4/1/the-queen-s-complaint/) explores the difficulty of unveiling oneself enough to submit oneself to God and His plans. How often do we, like Orual, veil our faces out of shame, wishing to hide ourselves from God? How often do we ignore God's calling?

It is my hope that this issue will serve to remind us all of our vocation of sainthood and God's glorious plan for us. 

Sincerely,\
Kaitlyn Tully\
