Along the rustic vineyard's edge\
There grew a tree with pears,\
And by this fruit we walked the ledge\
Of sin's most dreadful snares.

My friends and I would steal the fruit,\
In this we crossed the line.\
The next offense was that our loot\
We merely cast to swine.

I did not care, nor did I think.\
This deed festered within.\
Foolish I fell over sin's brink;\
I loved my deadly sin.

But Thou, in my depravity\
Had mercy on my soul.\
Thou shouldered my sin's gravity;\
By grace I was made whole.
