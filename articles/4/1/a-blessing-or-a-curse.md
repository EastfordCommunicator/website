Swift, I drew the poisoned blade\
And thrust its venom deep\
Into the hearts of those I love\
And made their spirits weep.

Wild, I spewed the scorching flame\
Across my neighbor's mind,\
To blacken all that flourished there\
And leave just ash behind.

Blind, I sowed the seeds of death\
In each surrounding field,\
Not thinking of the bitter crop\
My thoughtless plants would yield.

Crushed, I gathered deadly wounds\
And black and burning coals,\
Finally reaping haste's rewards\
And paying anger's tolls.

Meek, I sought the One who formed\
My hurtful, hateful blade\
To see if He could heal the wounds\
My poisoned sword had made.

Then, I learned that He could teach\
Swift swordsmen to be knights\
Who deal out wounds to enemies\
In hearty, holy fights.

Glad, I tamed my fire through Him\
To offer warmth and light\
And learned to nurture seeds of life\
In every field in sight.
