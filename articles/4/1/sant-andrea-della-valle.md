She still protests the possibility\
Of instantaneous love from only sight.\
Alas, we all are hypocrites at heart\
For she was swept from footing without fight\
From broiling cobblestones of busy Rome\
The wooden narthex was a sweet respite.\
She curious waited just behind the guide\
Who must go through an historical rite.\
But when the heavy door was barely cracked,\
Attribute to exhaustion if you will\
Her spirit falling to its knees in awe,\
But who conceived that sunlight so could spill\
In liquid down the column in her view?\
And then the door was open to fulfill\
Or nay, confirm, the love already formed\
Enchanted by a solemn golden thrill.\
Upswept, her eyes drank in far more than light:\
The frescoes' begging long and tender gaze\
And pillars of the palest minted green\
Bathed in a reverent glow of gilded haze.\
Protecting small recesses to each side\
Mysterious beckoning, less washed in rays\
And over all a silence gently drapes:\
A chastity as covering overlays.\
What words can she describe her wonder with\
The atmosphere, so lasting a caress,\
And not a photograph she's witnessed since\
Can capture its vast weight and tenderness.\
Was it pure fate her favorite was the first\
Of each competing church she would assess?\
Or does a first impression blindly cast\
A captivation she could not suppress?\
And though the time has passed as time will do,\
She dreams of her green-golden church by day\
Her goal and hope on this earth to return\
To wander in the stillness as she may\
And bask in that embrace of gold once more\
Pre-echoing a place of no decay\
Attraction of a moment and a glimpse\
Impossible to ever cast away.
