In the poem, "The Church-Porch," which, appropriate to its title, opens
*The Temple,* George Herbert's book of sacred poetry, Herbert advises
his reader that "A good digestion turneth all to health" (358). In the
immediate context, the line refers to what the reader ought to do with
"foreign wisdom", which is "to take all that is given" (355-6). But the
principle of good digestion is perhaps more widely applicable than its
immediate context. Certainly, at least, it has a wider applicability in
terms of reading Herbert's poems, or, rather, one might say that
Herbert's poetry invites the reader to apply the principle of "good
digestion" to the mental or spiritual or *imaginative* habit of making
meaning of the world around them. The analogy seems to indicate that the
matter of the world at large presents itself to the one who understands
it rightly, to the one who uses "good digestion," as a deeply and
spiritually infused warp and woof of meaning. To engage it imaginatively
and with right understanding is matter of furnishing the soul, as
Herbert says later in the poem when he refers to taking stock of the
day's events in the morning and evening as "dress\[ing\] and
undress\[ing\] thy soul" (453).

The analogy of good digestion is perhaps clear enough that it doesn't
require a great deal of explanation to make sense of. As I just noted,
Herbert seems to take for granted that his readers will catch the idea
of a right understanding, and that they will take the meaning of "right
understanding" as a sound intellect grounded in the Scriptures and the
doctrines of Christianity. Certainly one needs go no further to
understand what Herbert is saying in the poem in question, but I would
suggest that an elaboration upon the principle as Herbert invokes it,
and particularly a glance at the way that he imaginatively makes use of
it in his own poetry will reveal not only an organizing principle of
*The Temple*, but an imaginative habit of mind shared by many poets of
faith---notably including Herbert's contemporary John Done---and
recommended as a way of seeing to all people of faith. In what follows,
I want to examine the particularly sacramental understanding of being
that permeates Herbert's imagery and poetics, glance at Donne's usage of
the same, and perhaps touch on what this sort of implications this type
of poetics might have for a theory of meaning.

The images and rhythms of sacrament are central to Herbert's poetry, and
if "The Church Porch" is any guide, they are commended as a center of
life itself. He advises the "sweet youth" to whom the poem is addressed:

> Twice on the day his due is understood;\
> For all the week thy food so oft he gave thee.\
> Thy cheer is mended; bate not of the food,\
> Because 'tis better, and perhaps may save thee.\
> &tab;Thwart not th' Almighty God: O be not cross.\
> &tab;Fast when thou wilt but then, 'tis gain, not loss. (391-396)

The explicit advice given in these lines refers most probably not to the
sacrament of the Eucharist itself, the food references notwithstanding,
but to the Anglican services of morning and evening prayer. The "food"
given twice a day "all the week" that one should "bate not of" is likely
not the bread and the wine so much as the spiritual food of the Word and
the liturgy. Yet it is telling that Herbert uses the imagery of food and
feeding. It reminds us that both the hearing of the Word and the taking
of the elements are acts of feeding on "the body of Christ." The one act
is implicated in the other and both acts together find their meaning as
outward signs -- or sacraments, if you will -- of the believer's *real*
oneness with Jesus.

The image of spiritual feeding in worship and prayer is connected in the
lines above with the gift of our daily bread, and especially as one is
enjoined to engage it in twice per day, the idea is conveyed that just
as our daily bread nourishes our body, the worship nourishes our soul,
which is to say, the sacramental act of worship sustains the believer's
daily experience -- recall the dressing and undressing of the soul---and
provides a sacramental frame for the business of living and making
meaning of life. The idea of a sacramental frame is emphasized by its
placement in a poem entitled, "The Church-Porch." The porch itself, of
course, would be a physical frame through which one enters into worship
and the poem is a discursive frame through with the reader enters into
*The Temple* proper. Incidentally, the metaphor of feeding continues in
the subsequent poem, "Superliminare"---the superliminare would be the
lintel over the threshold of the church---in which the reader is invited
to "approach, and taste/ The church's mystical repast" (3-4).

Ostensibly, the invitation to feed, like the invitation to worship, is
an invitation into a sacred space, a space set apart from "the world."
Such is perhaps indicated even by the title, *The Temple*. And yet
inside the temple, one finds poems on a variety of subjects, some of
which -- "The World," for instance---are not explicitly sacred, as such.
Moreover, one recalls that even in "The Church Porch", the entrance
poem, a great deal of instruction for everyday life is given, among
which is the advice with which I opened, that "A good digestion turneth
all to health" (358). Perhaps what is suggested by Herbert's structure
here is that all the world---all the experience of a believer---is the
Temple. Or at least it is for the one who has the "good digestion" to
"turn all to health." That is to say one who has the imagination to see
everything that is as sacrament.

It would likely be useful to pause for a moment and consider what is
meant by the assertion that everything is sacrament, or maybe a better
way to put it would be to say that being itself is sacramental.
Theologian Hans Boersma, in his book *Heavenly Participation,* explains
a concept he calls "sacramental ontology" in terms of the medieval
understanding of "mystery" (21). "The word 'mystery' did not have quite
the same connotations \[in the late Middle Ages\] that it has for us
today," Boersma writes (21). Whereas we tend to think of the word in
terms inspired by detective fiction, i.e. we think mysteries as puzzles
to be solved by investigation, the medieval mind thought of it
differently. For them, Boersma says,

> "Mystery" referred to realities behind the appearances that one could
> observe by mans of the senses. That is to say, though our hands, eyes,
> ears, nose, and tongue are able to access reality, they cannot *fully*
> grasp reality. They cannot comprehend it. The reason for this basic
> incomprehensibility of the universe was that the world was, as the
> poet Gerard Manley Hopkins famously put it, "charged with the grandeur
> of God." Even the most basic created realities that we observe as
> human beings carry an extra dimension, as it were. (21)

That dimension, according to Boersma, is the dimension of sacramental
meaning. "Throughout the Great Tradition," he says, "when people spoke
of the mysterious quality of the created order, what they meant was that
this created order---along with all other temporary and provisional
gifts of God---was a sacrament" (22).

This sacramental ontology that Boersma describes as the typical
understanding of creation in the Middle Ages is also on display in the
poetry of George Herbert and many of his contemporaries, including John
Donne. Likely, it informs the very structuring of his magnum opus under
the rubric of a Temple. It certainly informs a great deal of the
specific poetic imagery in the collection, including the poet's
understanding of his very self, which he describes as "a broken altar .
. . Made of a heart, and cemented with tears" ("The Altar" 1-2). The
imagery obviously references numerous scriptural verses such as Ezekiel
11:19 and 36:26, as well as Zecharaiah 7:12 that refer to the hardened
and "stony hearts" of sinful men, which must be broken by the power of
God almighty and reassembled through the act of repentence---recall the
broken stones of the heart are "cemented with tears" -- into an
instrument of "Sacrifice" and "praise" (15,12). The metaphor of the
hardened and stony heart is not the only scriptural image that Herbert
brings to bear on the poem, however, for the assembly of the altar from
broken stones also draws on directions given by the Lord to Moses in
Exodus 20:25 to "make me an altar of stone" (KJV). In that verse, Moses
is further directed, "Thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if
though lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it." These
directions are reflected in Herbert's poem when he asserts that the
"parts" of the altar "are as thy hand did frame; / No workman's tool
hath touch'd the same" (3-4). Indeed, he asserts that only the power of
God has the ability to "cut" the "HEART" of "such a stone" (5-9).

Thus it is that the speaker in Herbert's poem imagines himself as an
altar, a God-hewn instrument of sacrifice and praise, whose "hard heart"
(10) has been broken and reassembled by the power of the almighty. The
imagery, moreover, does not stand alone, but gathers its meaning from
synthetic allusion to a number of Bible verses that inform the speaker's
understanding of his own sacramental being. Even the shape of this poem,
which is clearly a first-person address of dedication and thus
ultimately descriptive of the speaker, invokes the image of an altar.
Put bluntly, the speaker imagines himself *as* an altar and gathers
meaning from partaking of the symbol.

But of course the image of the altar in the poem is more than just a
symbol. Indeed the synthetic identification of the speaker with the
image is a sacramental act. Boersma distinguishes between symbols and
sacraments by noting that there is a qualitative difference in the level
of participation between them. One might take him to be saying the
symbol merely refers to a reality whereas a sacrament partakes. He
explains the distinction thusly:

> A road sign with the silhouette of a deer symbolizes the presence of
> deer in the area, and its purpose is to induce drivers to slow down.
> Drivers will not be so foolish as to veer away from the sign for fear
> of hitting the deer that is symbolized on the road sign. The reason is
> obvious: the symbol of the deer and the deer in the woods are two
> completely separate realities. The former is a sign referring to the
> latter, but in no way do the two co-inhere. It is not as though the
> road sign carries a mysterious quality, participating somehow in the
> stags that roam the forests. . . . The distance between the two
> \[things\] makes clear that there is no real connection between the
> two of them. Things are different with sacraments. Unlike mere
> symbols, sacraments actually *participate* in the mysterious reality
> to which they point. (22-23)

This mysterious quality of participation is on display in "The Altar"
and indeed in most, if not all, of Herbert's poems in *The Temple.* In
the poem in question, the speaker really *is* an Altar in some
mysterious, metaphysical sense, and his existence gathers meaning from
forging an imaginative understanding of that sacramental reality. The
speaker really participates the image of an altar, which itself
participates in a warp and woof of Scriptures that lay bare meaningful
truths about the relationship between human hearts and stones, and about
the singular role of the Almighty in shaping those stones into
instruments of sacrifice and praise. The result is a synthetic fabric of
meaning from which the threads are very difficult to untangle and
isolate, but according to Boersma, that is the point: it is the
mysterious nature of the sacrament to be beyond our ultimate
comprehension (21). It is not something that we can "fully grasp"
analytically, which is arguably why it must be engaged in and expressed
by the poetic imagination, as opposed to prosaic homiletics.

The logic of the sacramental ontology of the Great Tradition as Boersma
explains it entails that everything that has being has sacramental
meaning. It's a profound claim, and likely spurs the immediate objection
that there must be numerous inanimate objects that simply are. Moreover,
one might ask, what about deeds of evil, acts and articulations of
unsanctified hearts that would at first glance be even anti-sacramental.
Herbert provides an answer to such objections in "The Sacrifice," the
poem which immediately follows "The Altar" in *The Temple* and is spoken
from the point of view of the suffering Christ. The poem as a whole is a
master class in synthesizing seemingly disparate biblical images into a
coherent whole of meaning that finds its touchstone in the Incarnate
Word. The speaker Christ sums up the poetics of the piece when, after
recounting the mocking and ironic gestures of obeisance from his
tormentors, he asserts, "I, who am Truth, turn into truth their deeds"
(179). One of the most poignant instances of his recuperation of foul
deeds into beautiful truth occurs a few dozen lines earlier. Speaking of
the Jews who demanded his crucifixion, he says,

> Yet still they shout, and cry, and stop their ears,\
> Putting my life among their sins and fears,\
> And therefore wish *my blood on them and theirs:*\
> &tab;Was ever grief like mine?\
> See how spite cankers things. These words aright\
> Used, and wished, are the whole world's light:\
> But honey is their gall, brightness their night:\
> &tab;Was ever grief like mine? (105-112)\

There are a couple of sacramental truths that are illustrated in the
passage. One is the way that the words of the Jews contain a sacramental
truth through their participation in the Word which gives them meaning.
Their expression of desire to bear the blood of Christ, which is a
reference to Matthew 27:25, which is an admission of responsibility for
his death, if it were only "used aright", would be understood as a
desire to be covered by the blood of Christ in the New Testament sense
of justification, and thus be a desire for our salvation. Thus, even
their words of guilt, an evil articulation, are turned to Truth, and
can't help but mean righteously as they signify "the whole world's
light" (110). However, and this is the second truth to notice, in order
to signify this truth, the words must be understood aright. That is to
say, they must be turned to health by a "good digestion." The meaning
capital of the sacrament is there, but it must be partaken of and
participated in by the sanctified imagination of the reader.

Another masterstroke of sacramental imagery is on display in the stanza
from lines 201-204, in which the Speaker Christ ponders the irony of the
imagery of the Cross:

> *O all ye who pass by, behold and see;*\
> Man stole the fruit, but I must climb the tree;\
> The tree of life to all, but only me :\
> &tab;Was ever grief like mine?

In this stanza, the image of the "tree" passes fluidly from the Tree of
the Knowledge of Good and Evil to the Cross to the Tree of Life. The
image begins as a symbol of death from Genesis and then passes to
another symbol of death from the New Testament. That symbol (the Cross)
morphs into a symbol of life, which in turn, hearkens back to another
symbol of life from Genesis. The symbols are all distinct on the
surface, and yet they all co-inhere and slide fluidly from one to
another in a coherent sacramental instance of meaning. Here again, it is
important to note that the sacramental meaning of the imagery is
ultimately synthetic and inextricable. If one part of the sacramental
matrix is removed, the synthetic meaning of the whole loses itself
entirely. The meaning is metaphysical and mysterious, and as such is
better evoked through an expression of the poetic imagination than it is
any faculty of analysis. Moreover, the sacramental meaning, fluid as it
is, is contained by the channel of the Scriptures, which provide the
touchstone for interpretation.

Herbert, of course, is not the only poet to engage in such a poetics of
sacramental meaning. Boersma mentions Gerard Manley Hopkins in passing,
but another master of employing sacramental imagery in his work is
Herbert's contemporary John Donne. I've not time here to do much more
than glance at Donne's usage of sacramental imagery in his poetry, and
the choice of poem is almost entirely arbitrary, but it is perhaps
instructive to examine the meaning that Donne draws from such a simple
thing as the geographical orientation of his person in the poem "Good
Friday, 1613. Riding Westward."

That he happens to be riding Westward on Good Friday, a day when his
"Soules forme bends towards the East," puts the speaker in a position
from which he draws an immense amount of meaning (10). If he were
looking East, he says, he "should see a Sunne, by rising set" (11). The
Sun in the line, is clearly the Lord Christ, "rising" by being lifted on
the Cross, which act is also his "setting" by bringing about his death
and causing him to be laid in the ground, i.e. below the horizon. But
"that setting," the speaker asserts, will "endlesse day beget" (12).
Thus, the speaker's position, facing away from the sunrise on a sacred
day that recalls the death of Christ on his behalf, prompts a poetic
meditation, wherein is pondered the sacramental meaning of sunrise and
sunset as partaking in the crucifixion and death of Christ, which
themselves beget the endless "sunrise" of salvation of the soul, to be
ultimately realized materially in heaven. The images of sunrise and
sunset coalesce with the images of Christ raised on the Cross and
lowered into the grave, and all of that co-inheres with the image of
heaven as an endless sunrise in what is once again an inextricable
synthesis of sacramental meaning. The poem, as are many of Donne's
poems, is rife with such imagery. It ends with the speaker imagining his
back being towards the East, and by implication towards Christ, as being
symbolic of a posture of being ready "to receive / Corrections, till thy
mercies bid me leave" (37-38), another image of sacramental meaning.
There are of course more instance of this sort of sacramental poetics in
Donne, as there are in Herbert, but perhaps this has been enough to
illustrate the point for this afternoon.

Of course, a great deal of what I have been saying here about the
sacramental imagery in Herbert and Donne is not entirely new. Their
idiosyncratic usage of thick and inextricable imagery is what earned
them the name "metaphysical poets." But to study their imagery as only
metaphysical, as opposed to sacramental, misses something of the
implicit claims of reality in their work. What Donne and Herbert, and
other poets who deal in metaphysical imagery, are about is more than
just being clever. What they are about is giving imaginative expression
to the sacramental reality, or maybe the real sacramentality would be a
better way to say it, of Creation itself. Moreover, I would contend that
given its synthetic and mysterious nature, that sacramentality can
best---maybe only---be expressed poetically, due to the genre's
evocative nature of discourse.
