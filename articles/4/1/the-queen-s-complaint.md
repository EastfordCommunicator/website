The ever-veiled protagonist of C.S. Lewis\'s *Till We Have Faces* has
learned to hide
her physical ugliness well. Once spurned and mocked for her deformity,
Orual, Queen of Glome, now hides her face behind a veil (5, 13, 70,
205). It is, as she calls it, \"a sort of treaty made with my ugliness\"
(205). But the thickest fabric in Glome cannot conceal the ugliness that
seethes within her. Beneath the proud breast of Glome\'s warrior queen
lies a heart frothing with bitterness and anger (3-4, 283-284). That
bitterness has given birth to Orual\'s complaint against the gods (3).
Ostensibly, that complaint is the first part of the book that Lewis
wrote (283). As the second part of the book will show, however, Orual\'s
\"Book\" is merely her attempt to veil her ugly soul like she has veiled
her ugly face. Only when the veil of the Book is stripped away and Orual
sees the ugliness of her own heart can her soul---and her face---be made
beautiful.

On the surface, Orual\'s complaint does not seem unjust. Her words are
irate, even vindictive, but they are substantive. The gods have taken
something from Orual, something she claims that she deserves. They
have taken away her younger half-sister, Psyche (283). As Lewis
reveals through Psyche's name, he has lifted his plot from the classic
myth of *Cupid and Psyche*, specifically from the version found in
*The Golden Ass,* a prose compilation of myth by Silver Age fablist
Lucius Apuleius Platonicus (353). Lewis calls Apuleius\'s work a
\"novel\" , although the term may be somewhat anachronistic (353).
Both Apuleius\'s and Lewis\'s works tell of a beautiful young
princess, Psyche, who is demanded by a male deity (Cupid in Apuleius,
the god of the Mountain in Lewis) as a sacrifice (Apuleius 4.32-33,
Lewis 63). The girl is to be left on the mountain, alive, for the god
to find (Lewis 56, Apuleius 4.33) In both cases, the kingdom offering
Psyche does not know whether the god intends to kill Psyche or marry
her. She is to be, in Apuleius\'s words, *ornatam mundo funerei
thalami---*\"adorned with the purity of the funereal marriage-bed\"
(4.33). Thus, Psyche is left on the mountain, awaiting the god. This
is Orual\'s complaint: that the gods \"gave me nothing in the world
but Psyche and then took her away from me\" (283).

When the god arrives, however, he takes Psyche as his wife and brings
her to his mountain home (Apuleius 5.5, Lewis 129). Soon afterward,
Orual (or, in Apuleius\'s novel, two unnamed older sisters) arrive on
the mountain, filled with envy (Apuleius 5.11, Lewis 116). As a
character, Orual bears little similarity to Psyche\'s sisters in the
original myth. Their envies are very different: Apuleius\'s sisters
mainly envy the status that their sister enjoys as the wife of a god,
while Orual envies the god\'s possession of Psyche herself (Apuleius
5.9). Orual is not content to enjoy Psyche\'s company during her
visits to the Mountain; she must own Psyche, exercising exclusive
sovereignty over her. Thus, Orual is a far better developed character
than Apuleius\'s sisters. Nevertheless, both serve the same function
within the plot. Orual (like Apuleius\'s sisters) convinces Psyche to
disobey the god\'s unexplained command not to see his face. She
convinces her to light a lamp in thegod\'s bedchamber (Apuleius 5.19,
Lewis 184). For her disobedience, Psyche is expelled from the mountain
(Apuleius 5.25, Lewis 197).

Yet, as its subtitle,\"A Myth Retold,\" suggests, Lewis\'s version is
critically different from that of Apuleius. Indeed, it is unique among
all retellings of this myth. As Lewis scholar Mark Edwards notes,
\"Lewis has taken none of his precursors for a model\" (127). For only
in Lewis\'s retelling of the myth does Orual find mercy. In *The
Golden Ass,* the newly banished Psyche tricks her sisters into leaping
off a precipice (5.27). Orual, on the other hand, lives long enough to
write her Book---her accusation against the gods. However, she also
lives long enough to bury her accusation. She lives long enough to be
redeemed---a complete redemption.. Her ugly face, her ugly soul, her
ugly book---all are made beautiful. Through a humble piece of cloth,
Orual tries to veil her hideous face. Through her Book, Orual tries to
veil her hideous heart. But for the god of the Mountain to redeem her,
both body and soul must be stripped naked.

Why does Orual feel the need to disguise her ugly heart? Consider why
she feels the need to disguise her ugly face. Orual ascends the
Mountain twice; both times, she wears her veil (107, 179). She says
elsewhere that she wears it \"because I wished to be secret\" (205).
But that begs the question:why does she wish to be secret? Both of her
journeys are pilgrimages: she goes to meet something that she
considers to be holy in some way. The first time she ascends, she
intends to bury Psyche\'s remains (101, 106). She believes her sister
died a sacrificial victim, and she leaves Glome wearing a veil (107).
The second time she ascends, she is again veiled, but she knows that
her sister is alive (178). Why, then, does she veil herself? The
answer comes unexpectedly after Psyche\'s banishment when the god of
the Mountain reveals himself to Orual:

> In the center of the light was something like a man\... A monster\...
> would have subdued me less than the beauty this face wore. And I think
> anger (what men call anger) would have been more supportable than the
> passionless and measureless rejection with which it looked upon me\...
> He rejected, denied, answered, and (worst of all) he knew, all I had
> thought, done or been..*.He made it to be as if, from the beginning, I
> had known that Psyche's lover was a god,* and as if all my doubtings,
> fears, guessings, debatings \... had been trumped-up foolery, dust
> blown in my own eyes by myself (196-197, italics added for emphasis).

Orual\'s account of her encounter with the god strongly suggests that
she knew the truth from the beginning. Her refusal to acknowledge it
is not merely, as Elaina Tverberg claims, self-delusion (14-15). It
goes far deeper. Orual had enough evidence to come to the truth, but
she rejected it out of pride. Why else does she wear a veil *before*
her encounter with the god? Why does she want to be secret? It seems
likely that she knows that she approaches the holy. She knows that she
approaches the god.

After Orual meets the god, she is embarrassed to return to Glome with
her face uncovered. Conviction meets her at every turn. Even her
rationalist tutor seems to point her unawares to the shining figure
she saw on the mountain. She wonders \"whether I had never at all
believed her lover was a mountainy man\" (203). This causes her a
great deal of mental anguish, much of which she projects onto her
insecurity over her ugliness. She concludes that wearing a veil only
on the Mountain is not enough:

> Hitherto, like all my countrywomen, I had gone bareface; on those two
> journeys up the Mountain I had worn a veil *because I wished to be
> secret.* I now determined that I would go always veiled. I have kept
> this rule, within doors and without, ever since. It is a sort of
> treaty with my ugliness. (204-205)

Here, her concept of her outer ugliness and her inner ugliness
intermingle. She claims that she wears a veil because she is
physically ugly. Yet Orual has been acutely aware of her physical
ugliness for her whole life, and not until now has she worn a veil (5,
13). What changed? As she beheld the face of the god of the Mountain,
she became painfully aware of her spiritual ugliness. Throughout the
book, Orual\'s physical ugliness and her heart\'s ugliness are deeply
intertwined.

This is not a flaw in Lewis\'s design. In the real world, there are many
beautiful souls with ugly bodies, and there are still more ugly bodies
with beautiful souls. In Orual and Psyche\'s world, however, the
polysemous images of allegory reign supreme (Edwards 114**).** As she
becomes more aware of the ugliness within, she desperately tries to
cover the ugliness without. Until the end of Part I, she is satisfied.

Before she writes her Book, however, Orual is radically unsettled yet
again. While on a campaign, she meets the priest of a new deity,
apparently based on her half-sister (275). The story that the priest
presents, however, is not the story that Orual remembers. It is
virtually identical to Apuleius\'s retelling (Lewis 274-282, Apuleius
4.28-6.25), and, like Apuleius, the priest unhesitatingly paints Orual
in an unflattering manner. Though the heavens do not rend and no
figure clothed in light appears, Orual finds herself again
face-to-face with the gods, and this time, she resolves to hide more
than her face:

> That moment I resolved to write this book\... Often, though I had seen
> a god myself. .. the memory of his voice and face was kept in one of
> those rooms of my soul that I didn\'t lightly unlock. Now, instantly,
> I knew I was facing them-I with no strength, and they with all; I
> visible to them, they invisible to me; I easily wounded\...they
> invulnerable; I one, they many. (278-279)

Orual claims that, by writing her Book, she intends to \"set down the
truth\" , to \"accuse the gods,\" to lay bare the injustices that she
has experienced at the hands of the divine (279, 3).

Her writing, however, suggests that Orual is trying to convince
herself of the justice of her case just as much as she attempts to
convince her readers. Even when the god appears to hear Psyche\'s
banishment, when she all but accuses him of changing the past, she
cannot bring herself to state her case affirmatively: \"He made it to
be as if, from the beginning, I had known that Psyche\'s lover was a
god\... Was it so? Or, at least, had it been so in the very past,
before this god changed the past?\"(197) Her questions pile up, but
she cannot directly accuse him. She already doubts her own accusation.
As she mentions, \"a Greek verse says that even the gods cannot change
the past\" (196). It seems that the verse is right---that Orual knew
(or at least suspected) that Psyche\'s husband was a god. Yet she had
suppressed this evidence, tried with all her might to believe
otherwise. Why? Orual was jealous of Psyche, just as the priest had
said (278). To conceal this jealousy, Orual writes her book. When the
priest alleges that \"they \[the sisters\] were jealous\"(278), Orual
immediately concludes, \"that moment I resolved to write this book\"
(278). Orual presents her case: she was never jealous of Psyche, she
says. Yet even her defense---which veils her heart in brisk
rhetoric--- reveals a woman desperate to conceal her own guilt.

Only in the second half of Lewis\'s book is Orual\'s Book exposed.
Only then is the veil stripped away, and Orual\'s heart---and
face---lie bare before the gods. In a vision, Orual finds herself
summoned before a council of the gods, ordered to read her complaint.
Yet when she is about to begin, she is aghast to discover that the
book she is holding is not the book she remembers writing:
>
> I looked at the roll in my hand and saw at once that it was not the
> book I had written. It couldn\'t be; it was far too small. And too
> old-a little, shabby, crumpled thing, nothing like my great book\...I
> thought I would throw it down and trample on it. I\'d tell them
> someone had stolen my complaint and slipped this thing into my hand
> instead. Yet I found myself unrolling it. It was written all over
> inside, but the hand was not like mine. It was all a vile
> scribble-each stroke mean and yet savage\... But already I heard
> myself reading it. (330-331)

Orual claims that this is not the book she has written. That is true, in
a sense. The ink on papyrus is different. The ideas---and the sentiment
that conveys them---are hers. Here Orual beholds her book unveiled. As
he has been doing throughout the book, Lewis continues to draw
connections between the physical veil that lies over Orual \'s face and
the metaphorical veil that lies over her heart. Just seconds ago, Orual
was stripped naked before the council (330). Her ugly body is on full
display. Now, her heart must be unveiled as well.

Orual begins to read her complaint. The language is ravenous, that of
devouring. Earlier in the book, one character remarks that loving and
devouring may be the same thing (56). If that is true, then Orual
exemplifies this devouring, all-consuming love. She screeches,

> Jealous of Psyche? Not while she was mine...I was my own and Psyche
> was mine and no one else had any right to her\... What should I care
> for some horrible, new happiness which I hadn\'t given her and which
> separated her from me? Do you think I wanted her to be happy, that
> way? It would have been better if I\'d seen the Brute tear her in
> pieces before my eyes\... Did you ever remember whose the girl was?
> She was mine. *Mine.* Do you not know what the word means? Mine!
> (332-333)

The hideousness that lay lurking in Orual\'s heart has finally
revealed itself. As she stands before the council, naked, helpless,
and hideous, she realizes that the gods have given her a full and
final answer: \"the complaint was the answer\" (335). When Orual sees
her own heart unveiled, she recognizes that she, not the god of the
Mountain, was grasping and unjust. The Book, her complaint, was the
outworking of her heart.

Hence, Orual realizes that she is ugly in body and soul. To her
amazement, however, the god of the Mountain makes her beautiful---both
in body and in soul. When she meets him one last time---this time, as
she humbly adores him---he allows her to write a book that is as
beautiful as she. In Lewis\'s cosmology, a beautiful book flows from a
beautiful soul. The change becomes evident when Orual reunites with
Psyche and declares, \"never again will I call you mine; but all there
is of me shall be yours\" (348). Then, alongside her sister, she
awaits the judgment of the god. When he arrives, however, Orual finds
that she is changed indeed. She looks down at her reflection in a
nearby pool and is amazed: \"Two Psyches, the one clothed, the other
naked? Yes, both Psyches, both beautiful (if that mattered now) beyond
all imagining, yet not exactly the same\" (350) The god of the
Mountain, the one she rejected and spurned and publicly accused, has
given her Psyche\'s beauty. Such grace overwhelms her. She knows it is
far better than what she deserves. In awe and gratitude, she hastens
to write a new Book, one that tells of all that the god has done for
her (287).

The Book she writes, like the face she was given, is now imbued with
Psyche\'s beauty. Gone is the irate, vindictive Orual of Part I; in
her stead stands Orual, the glorified and grateful. Her descriptions
of the god of the Mountain take on a particularly new tint: she
describes him as \"the most dreadful, the most beautiful, the only
dread and beauty there is\" (350), yet his presence brings her joy
(349-350). This is one of hundreds of examples of tonal shift between
the two halves of Lewis\'s book. Many Lewis scholars, such as Curtis
Gmenler, read this dramatic shift as symbolic of the difference
between the mind pre-conversion and the mind post-conversion.

Under this theory, the Orual of Part I sees the world \"through a
complex mixture of acquired objectivity, growing understanding, and
continued, resentful self-deception\" (Gruenler 252); the Orual of
Part II sees by the light of \"converted lucidity\" (252). Gruenler
does well to tie Orual\'s transformation to conversion, but his
descriptions of the two halves of the book do justice neither to the
blockheaded obstinacy of Part I nor the rapturous wonder of Part II.
The beauty of Orual\'s new Book is not that she sees but what she
sees.

Hence, Orual\'s Book---that veil cast over her heart---is transformed,
like its author, from hideous and evil to beautiful and good. Like
every book, hers flows from the soul of its author, betraying her
thoughts even as she desires to conceal them. Yet it is a happy
betrayal. Only when Orual confesses her own inner ugliness can she
become beautiful in body and soul, and only when she reads her Book in
its unveiled form does she see the filthy depravity within her soul.
Her Book---what she intended to be a complaint against the gods---has
brought her to peace with the god of the Mountain.
