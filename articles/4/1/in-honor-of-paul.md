His body bent beneath the weight\
Of time made long by chains,\
His mem'ry bruised with images\
That fill his heart with pains,\
His soul renounces earthly care,\
While Christ with him remains.\
For though he suffers long in chains\
While in this mortal coil,\
He scorns no pain as one too great\
Nor murmurs at his toil.\
He knows that Jesus gives a prize\
No earthly wounds can spoil.\
O favored saint! Mark well the words\
Of dear Apostle Paul;\
And turn your eyes to Jesus Christ\
Who suffered for us all,\
That, though they bind your body here,\
Your spirit's chains will fall.
