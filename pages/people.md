# Editorial Staff

## Adam Minor, Editor-in-Chief


## Micah Torcellini, Web Editor
Micah Torcellini is a musicologist and web developer. His
love of baroque music and Latin means that he often feels as if
he lives in the wrong century, but he also likes being able to 
use the Web both to read and to share writing. He is still trying
to understand what the overlap between web technology and harpsichords
is, but he might find out what it is eventually if he keeps
thinking about it for long enough. 
[His duck, Scramble](https://scrambletheduck.org), is a local celebrity
enough to be recognized by the Connecticut General Assembly. 
He also occasionally puts  writing on 
[his website](https://micah.torcellini.org/). 
He can be contacted at [webdevelopment@torcellini.org](mailto:webdevelopment@torcellini.org)
