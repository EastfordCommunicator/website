Hello PHC! As Christmas approaches, *Westmarch* is excited to announce the submission period for our second issue of Fall 2023, “Laughter and Good Humor”, themed around Charles Dickens. We’re looking for criticism, fiction, narrative nonfiction, and poetry that talks about cheer, fireplaces, the woods, Victorian life, and all things Christmas. This is the perfect issue for your Lewis and Dickens class papers, but we'll accept anything that fits the theme. Submissions close November 15th, and we will be going to print on December 4th. Send those papers to [westmarch@westmarchjournal.org](mailto:westmarch@westmarchjournal.org) by the 15th. We look forward to reading your work!

~The Westmarch Team
