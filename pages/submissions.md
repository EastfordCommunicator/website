PHC’s literary journal, *Westmarch*, is now accepting submissions for our forthcoming issue. This issue will be entitled, “To All Angels and Saints,” in reference to a poem by English priest and poet, George Herbert. We are looking for any literary papers, short stories, narrative nonfiction, or poetry that deal with Heaven, angels, or great Christian figures. Tangential topics like celestial bodies, worship, prayer, miracles, or virtues, are also entirely welcome!

 The submission deadline is September 29, and we will be releasing this issue on November 1, in honor of All Saints’ Day. Please send your submissions to [westmarch@westmarchjournal.org](mailto:westmarch@westmarchjournal.org). 

Thank you from the Westmarch Editorial Team!
