# Editorial Staff
## Lauren Crane, Editor-in-Chief
Lauren is a senior majoring in literature. Although
she was an avid reader as a child, Lauren developed
her love for British literature after reading Jane
Austen in high school. Her literary kindred spirit
is Marianne Dashwood, as evidenced by her love for
Romantic poetry and melancholy walks in the rain, 
and it is likely these sensibilities that led her to
the literature major. After graduation, Lauren hopes
to share her love for literature by teaching. 

## Anna Fox, Content Editor
When Anna was small, she would hide in corners so that 
she could read instead of doing her homework. She has
always loved stories, both reading them and writing them.
At PHC, she is a literature major, which is nice, because
now she can hide in corners reading and it is her homework.
She is a senior, and hopes to someday help other children
find the same love for storytelling that she has. 

## Kaitlyn Tully, Content Editor
Kaitlyn Tully is a junior Literature and APP major at PHC. 
Her childhood in Florida consisted primarily of exploring
different mediums of storytelling including poetry, plays,
short stories, and novels. She has always found great joy
in reading classic literature and in writing her own stories. 
Admittedly, her very first character "JEmma" did not last very
long (her attempt at spelling Jenna was thwarted by the limited
letter stickers in her possession). This traumatic instance
likely influenced her now severe disdain at naming characters. 

## Abbie Mourey, Content Editor
Abbie Mourey was born and raised in New York's Southern Tier
region. When she's not reading, you can find Abbie listening
(and badly dancing) to an assortment of jazz, classical, pop,
country, and spontaneous worship music. Abbie came to love
reading as a child, and she fell in love with classic when she
was thirteen after reading *Pride and Prejudice* for the 
first time. Abbie appreciates rich coffee, deep conversations
with good people, and British TV shows. Abbie is a sophomore
literature major, and she is most looking forward to the Lit
Crit and Brit Lit courses.

## Elyse Burgess, Layout Editor
Elyse Burgess is a senior Classical Liberal Arts major with a
Journalism minor who is so used to getting mistaken for a 
Literature major that she joined the Westmarch team to confuse
people even more. She loves bringing the beauty and order
of graphic design to the beautiful words printed in Westmarch. 
Her other hobbies include staring at a blank Microsoft Word
document while trying to think of something to write, eating
baked goods, and telling people to look at the moon.
