## Kaitlyn Tully, Editor-in-Chief
Content editor (2022-2023)

Kaitlyn Tully is a senior Literature and APP major at PHC. 
Her childhood in Florida consisted primarily of exploring 
different mediums of storytelling including poetry, plays, 
short stories, and novels. She has always found great joy 
in reading classic literature and in writing her own stories. 
Admittedly, her very first character “JEmma” did not last very 
long (her attempt at spelling Jenna was thwarted by the limited 
letter stickers in her possession). This traumatic instance 
likely influenced her now severe disdain at naming characters. 
She has since switched primarily to literary criticism (mostly 
because there is no requirement to invent character names), 
and hopes to pursue a PhD in Literature along with a law degree next year.

## Abbie Mourey, Content Editor
Abbie was born and raised in New York’s Southern Tier 
region. Her delight in books began as a child, while reading 
chapter books with her dad. Abbie’s love for classics was 
ignited after she read Pride and Prejudice for the first 
time at the age of thirteen. When she’s not working on a
paper, you can find Abbie drinking coffee, taking long walks, a
nd watching British TV shows. Abbie is a junior Literature 
major, and she is most looking forward to Lit Crit and Directed
Research Writing projects.

## Faith Thompson, Content Editor
Faith Thompson penned her earliest story at the age of four, 
recasting her despised preschool teacher into a heinous villain. 
Since then, she has employed the art of storytelling to throw 
light into dark places and provide some much-needed personal 
therapy. She is a senior Literature major with a minor in history, 
and her favorite kind of scholarship is at the intersection of 
those two disciplines. In the future, she plans to edit fiction 
for a living while trying to write the next great American novel. 

## Grace Johnson, Content Editor
Grace Johnson is a senior literature major from California. 
Even as a child she loved getting lost in a riveting story, 
from her childhood adventures with the Boxcar Children to her 
middle school quests with the Fellowship of the Ring. She 
scribbled her first short stories on colored construction 
paper (complete with her own stick figure illustrations), 
but it wasn’t until college that she began to pursue writing 
more seriously. Her favorite aspect of stories is their power to
shape hearts and minds for the better. When not reading or 
writing, she enjoys buying armloads of used books, hanging out 
with her friends, and listening to music.


## Julia Adams, Content Editor
Julia is a junior majoring in English. As a child, she 
loved reading books and would finish them often in less 
than two days. Her family often called her a bookworm, 
which she whole heartedly embraced. One Christmas, 
Julia received an annotated version of Jane Austen’s Pride and
Prejudice and fell in love with the idea of literary analysis 
and delving into the historical and literary contexts 
of other works. When not reading, Julia is writing, 
drinking coffee with a friend, dancing, or spending time in the Word.

## Bethany Kawalec, Content Editor
Bethany is a storyteller and a traveler in what Tolkien calls 
the world of Faerie. Ever she since she could speak, she 
would regale her family with tales that lasted for hours, filled
with complex character arcs and subplots. Although she has 
(hopefully) gotten better at listening, too, her imagination 
is just as active. She also loves losing herself in a good book, 
where she meets new friends, adventures in strange faraway 
lands, and enjoys any and all descriptions of feasts and beautiful 
clothes. She also loves to write. Her dream is to become a 
best-selling author. Her favorite authors include C. S. Lewis,
Tolkien, Dickens, and Jack London. Becoming at Literature major 
was just a natural next step to fostering her passion for stories. 
When she’s not reading or writing, Bethany enjoys spending time 
with friends, hiking with her German Shepherds, swing dancing, 
and doing art.



## Micah Torcellini, Web Editor
Micah Torcellini is a senior Classical Liberal Arts major from
Connecticut (which he firmly believes is the best state). His
love of baroque music and Latin means that he often feels as if
he lives in the wrong century, but he also likes being able to 
use the Web both to read and to share writing. He is still trying
to understand what the overlap between web technology and harpsichords
is, but he might find out what it is eventually if he keeps
thinking about it for long enough. 
[His duck, Scramble](https://scrambletheduck.org), is a local celebrity
enough to be recognized by the Connecticut General Assembly. 
He also occasionally puts non-*Westmarch* writing on 
[his website](https://micah.torcellini.org/). One can email him at 
[webeditor@westmarchjournal.org](mailto:webeditor@westmarchjournal.org).

## Lauren Crane, Editor-in-Chief (2022-2023)
Lauren is a senior majoring in literature. Although
she was an avid reader as a child, Lauren developed
her love for British literature after reading Jane
Austen in high school. Her literary kindred spirit
is Marianne Dashwood, as evidenced by her love for
Romantic poetry and melancholy walks in the rain, 
and it is likely these sensibilities that led her to
the literature major. After graduation, Lauren hopes
to share her love for literature by teaching. 

## Anna Fox, Content Editor (2022-2023)
When Anna was small, she would hide in corners so that 
she could read instead of doing her homework. She has
always loved stories, both reading them and writing them.
At PHC, she is a literature major, which is nice, because
now she can hide in corners reading and it is her homework.
She is a senior, and hopes to someday help other children
find the same love for storytelling that she has. 

## Elyse Burgess, Layout Editor (2022-2023)
Elyse Burgess is a senior Classical Liberal Arts major with a
Journalism minor who is so used to getting mistaken for a 
Literature major that she joined the Westmarch team to confuse
people even more. She loves bringing the beauty and order
of graphic design to the beautiful words printed in Westmarch. 
Her other hobbies include staring at a blank Microsoft Word
document while trying to think of something to write, eating
baked goods, and telling people to look at the moon.
